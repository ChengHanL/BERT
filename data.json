    "To the man who saved my life and never knew",
    "On a rainy March day, 4 years ago, my parents were out of town and I had a full-fledged suicide plan in place. I turned my phone off, I had filled my dog\u2019s food and water bowls, I had my note printed out, and I sat solemnly in the silence of my home, enjoying what I believed was my final meal- a bowl of Kraft Mac n Cheese. \n\nYou see, I was a freshman in college, and had gotten raped by a man I had recently met. When I attempted to speak out against what happened to me, I was immediately labeled a whore. Anything I said was discredited by him and his friends, since I had freely chosen to go and see him at night. Besides, he was a Marine. His reputation was impeccable. People with so much to lose don\u2019t do things like that, right?\n\nAfter multiple attempts to tell my foreign parents that I was struggling mentally, and with all of those attempts being minimized to \u201cdepression is for the weak\u201d, I had had enough.\n\nHalfway through my Mac n Cheese, I heard a knock at my front door. Strange, since it was a Friday night and I was not expecting company. I decided to answer the door anyways. \n\nIt was a guy I had went to high school with. I did not consider him a friend, but he knew where I lived because we were partners for a high school group project years prior. He kept in touch after high school because during the time we spent working on our group project, he had discovered my closeted obsession for Pok\u00e9mon. He would occasionally send me interesting updates about the game. Despite this, I overlooked him and admittedly never really thought much about his presence in my life. \n\nI was, obviously, very confused why he had showed up to my house, unannounced. He reached into his pocket and handed me a pack of unopened Pok\u00e9mon cards. He said that he had been at the store, and remembered that we had briefly discussed a particular card set a few weeks prior, so he decided to buy it for me. He said that he had texted, asking if he could come drop it off, but that his message was not delivering. Since my house was on the route back to his, he decided to stop by to drop it off. It was a nice gesture, but in that moment, I could not have cared less. As I thanked him and went to close the door, he asked if I wanted to go for a drive. I said no thanks, and that I had other things planned for the night. He was never a pushy guy, but he insisted that I joined him. I sighed, and grabbed my jacket. \n\nHe aimlessly drove me around. We sat in absolute silence for hours, besides him occasionally asking if the temperature in his car was okay and if it was okay if he stopped for gas. I was confused on what we were doing. A part of me was afraid that he was working up the nerve to do what the Marine had done to me months prior. Another piece of me was terrified at the fact that I was too drained, my spirit so broken, to even care if he did. \n\nBut he didn\u2019t.\n\nHe drove. He drove until his tank was nearing empty. He went and filled his tank. And then, he kept driving. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t question it, but I guess I was just so relieved that my plans for the night had changed. In that moment, I knew that I, in fact, did not want to kill myself. When my mind came to that realization, I began sobbing hysterically. Would you believe me if I said that he simply kept on driving? He kept driving until I began to doze off. When he noticed, he took me home. As I was exiting his car, he said to me, \u201cAnything else planned for tonight?\u201d I shook my head no. He nodded, and thought for a moment, before saying, \u201cText me tomorrow to let me know how you liked the cards.\u201d I nodded and went inside. I took the suicide note I had sitting on the coffee table, and put it into my dad\u2019s shredder in his home office. I took the Pok\u00e9mon cards out of my pocket, and placed them in the place the note had been. I told myself that I would wait to open them the next morning. Because for the first time, in a very long time, there was a \u201cnext morning\u201d to look forward to. \n\n\nFrom that day on, Kraft Mac n Cheese became a food I would eat whenever I was feeling particularly low. Rather than it being a last meal of sorts, it now serves as a source of comfort- a reminder that there are always mini sources of joy in this world, whether that be a bowl of Mac n Cheese, or a pack of Pok\u00e9mon cards.",

They were fighting on the front porch while I was in the kitchen making a bottle for my 8 mo son who was sleeping in his crib on the other side of the house.

I was right outside the door when it happened and I can\u2019t get the sound out of my head. Luckily, my son slept through the whole thing and was quickly taken out of the house by his father while I called 911.

    "I was inches from committing suicide 6 months ago, today I signed a lease for the nicest apartments in my city. Hang in there.",
    "Long story short, over the summer I was planning on driving my car over the edge of a cliff after I dropped some people off on vacation. I was overwhelmed in life and saw no way out aside from ending it all. Felt like a disappointment because I dropped out of college, worked as a personal trainer at a gym where I was taken advantage of and forced to work 16-17 hour days for pennies. Lived in some slummy apartments with no AC and barely had any grocery money. I usually bummed pizza from local Pizza shops at the end of the night when someone hadn\u2019t picked up a carry out order. Sometimes I\u2019d get something, sometimes I\u2019d get told to fuck off. Got on average 3 hours of sleep aside from Saturday nights. Mental health was at an all time low.\n\nI made some changes that started with therapy.

It portrays suicide as something \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cmeaningful\u201d and not what it really is. And the whole \u201cblame it on other people even though they tried to help me\u201d thing? Nope nope nope, that\u2019s so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn\u2019t \u201chelp him enough\u201d even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it\u2019s just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she\u2019s still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful \u201csuicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people\u201d agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. \nIdk, personally I really don\u2019t like that show, and i think it\u2019s harmful. I once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend, and she was all like \u201cwho made you feel that way?\u201d like it was other people\u2019s fault.

Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. \n\nI'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she \"succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19\" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to \"heaven\" and not \"hell\" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed \"sin\". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.\n\nI posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying \"Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not.\" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. \n\nThey fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. \n\nI'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the \"eyes of God\". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.\n\nI feel so bad for her. If her parents made \\*me\\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.\n\nJust needed to vent, thanks for reading.",

I guess I have mental health issues but im not in therapy at the moment, the current situation put that a bit on the back burner. But in the past I hated myself and attempted to end my life on a handfull of occasions, getting always closer to breaking and doing it.\n\nMaybe three month ago I was approched by a social worker and he helped me find my way to a home for young men in rough situations in just a couple of weeks. It is still hard to belive how easy that was. For about a month and a half I just kinda houng out and got acclimated but kept some of my old habbits up (not drugs, just kinda being aimless). With Corona crashing the party, I spend all of my time at home and lazed around.\n\nBut this week I started to work in the extensive garden. Planting crops, installing watering systems and stuff. Today I planted 100+ onions, waterd some salat and cleaned up a volleyball field. I felt good doing that. Then I had myself a nice cold shower and sat down to write this. Im happy right now. Im happy that I enjoyed work. I put the fear that all this shit in my life was because Im just lazy behind me. I enjoy working. Im crying.",

This really hurts, but your empathy is a comfort.\n\nTo the folks that think I'm exaggerating or leaving something out, I implore you to drive to a small town, then take in the Trump bumper stickers on every car and Trump banners beside every house. I've driven by multiple Biden road signs with bullet holes in them out in the middle of nowhere. \n\nI have been trying to get my parents to stop berating me with Trump news for more than four years now. They have ruined dinners out, caused friction in relationships, and generally made my life stressful since the day he decided to run for office by talking about him constantly, aggressively, and refusing to listen to what anyone else has to say. This is not on me or for lack of trying to understand their POV.\n\nI really don't think I'm exaggerating or being rude to state that this is cult-like behavior. A cult is literally defined as \"a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object.\" This definitely fits the bill for a lot of small town Americans. Especially if you live in a city, take a look outside the concrete jungle and it's not hard to see why rural folks initially get sucked into this shit.",

You may think i\u2019m making this up but i\u2019m not i swear.\nTonight I held a knife to myself, and my cat ran to my side. At first I thought he was just trying to cuddle or get me to pet him, but I then noticed instead of rubbing into my hand, he was pushing the knife away. I broke down into tears and he immediately climbed into my lap. I moved and he laid beside me, and now refuses to let me out of his sight. His little paw is sitting on my arm, and when i move he moves. This is insane, but he stopped it, if it wasn\u2019t for my cat i\u2019d be dead.

I guess I want people to know that I tried. I fought back at my body and forced myself up, forced myself to do the bare minimum of existing and damnit - I was so proud. I want the satisfaction of \u2018doing the healthy thing\u2019 even though it was hard, and then I want the reward to be a sudden ability to live easily. \n\nBut it didn\u2019t come.

    "Yayyyy!!! Good for you! This is my favorite kind of post to see\u2014anywhere!\nI work in inpatient mental health and it might sound weird, but I LOVE when I have the chance to work with \u201cyounger\u201d patients\u2014like 35 and under\u2014because they tend to be the group that has the best likelihood of a good outcome. It\u2019s the group that usually has the strongest support system, the most resilience, and most importantly, deep down, the most hope for the future...which is how you end up with a post like this. \n\nIt\u2019s so great to see that even though things haven\u2019t come easily to you that you didn\u2019t give up and you fought through the roughest moments and that you accomplished such an amazing goal. And it\u2019s admirable that you took the steps to care for yourself when you were in crisis\u2014*at least* 8 times (wowza, x8!)\u2014and to do what you needed to to get back on your feet. I know you know that this doesn\u2019t mean the hard times are over and that there will be periods in your life where things get hard again. And I hope that you remember in the back of your mind that you\u2019ve made it back over and over and no matter how difficult it might seem in that moment, that you have it in you to make it back again\u2014and *again* and *again* if it comes down to that. You\u2019re strong and smart and clearly a fighter. Don\u2019t forget those things and don\u2019t forget this moment. \n\nKeep building your support system while you\u2019re in this good place and keep utilizing the resources that have worked for you in a preventative way, to *keep* yourself as healthy as possible. Know and remember the signs of a relapse and don\u2019t be afraid to get help again at the first sign of trouble. Strong people don\u2019t *not* need help\u2014strong people reach for it at the first sign of needing it. Strong people use what they\u2019ve learned to help themselves and rally for themselves and to *stay* strong and brave even when that means taking breaks to care for themselves or having moments/days/weeks/months/years of struggle. \nSpeaking out about what you\u2019ve been through is so admirable and it\u2019ll surely mean a lot to other people who are struggling and who think they\u2019ll never be able to fight their mental health issues enough to reach their own goals. Being honest like this will help you stay accountable with yourself and your mental health and will bring you an even larger support system. You have it in you to make such a positive impact on your own life *and* the lives of others. I hope you continue to speak out and to maybe even get involved with some mental health organizations/groups to spread your positivity/encouragement and be around like-minded, mental health stigma-breakers like yourself.\nYou have what it takes to fight this and to keep triumphing over it. I wish you the very best! Congrats and keep kicking ass! :)",

It's been 2 years now since therapy and meds and there is some improvement but everyday is a challenge. It breaks my heart to see any child appear unhappy especially being my own son.  I wonder what his future holds.  He's intelligent, great at making inventions and wants to know how things work.  He wants to be am engineer and I hope that he 2 graduates from college.  He wants to go to college but he hates school, his OCD makes it hard to make friends because he has to be right.  I hope as his mother I'm able to show him the help and support he needs to be successful.  Congratulations again!",

It\u2019s not uncommon for people in \u201ccaring professions\u201d to have issues with their own mental health, simply because of being the the type of person who *does* care so much and typically feel and experience things in a different way. \nI hope your new degree/field suits you even better and that you\u2019re doing well now!

I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found balance in your life through treatment and that you also have wonderful people who support you.  It\u2019s a winning combo.  Although our illness can be fatal, I think having a life punctuated by hospitalization doesn\u2019t have to be a a multiple life sentence.  With the right treatment and support I think recovery is possible: we can author our independence. I haven\u2019t fully integrated into society yet as a working member, but I think with patience and support independence is a great possibility.  Thank you for your above and beyond kind words.

    "Thank you! Good parents are often the unsung heroes of mental health recovery and I can tell your really empathetic to your sons care.  It\u2019s hard on those afflicted with the illness but having a family dynamic punctuated with hospitalizations of a loved one is no picnic either.  Treatment for mental illness is initially trial and error and it can be heartbreaking and dysfunctional when the doctors don\u2019t get it right.  It can go both ways with over medication and under medication so self advocacy is very important from the patient, and I can imagine this is can be harder to navigate with a child.  I think most kids hate school around that age, although I acknowledge his challenges.  There is light at the end of the tunnel and I totally believe your son will do just fine with support along the way.  He sounds like an interesting guy.  Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb ",

I sort of unconsciously put a poor girl in a therapist position by my text bombing/ venting.  I\u2019m definitely doing a lot better now that I have not one therapist but two.  My mom is a yoga practitioner and I have read a John Kabot Zinn book/ been a part of a meditation group, but my meditation practice has been sporadic.  It does relieve existential angst, anxiety/dread for me, so I usually meditate when I am suffering with slight depression or anxiety.  I made the mistake of trying to combat my schizoaffective solely by meditation/without meds when I first was diagnosed, but it inevitably lead to psychosis.",

I\u2019ve been helped a lot along the way.",

    "Thank you.  The associates degree was more of a slog finding out where my talents were with general ed courses, but when I relapsed I thought of how an associates degree would remove my dropping out of high school from the conversation.  Transferring to a state university where I got to pick my major was very gratifying; when I relapsed it helped that I had a lot of passion for the program and enjoyed getting back into the classroom as a social outlet/way to express myself.  The associates degree was more that I had something to prove, but when I continued with my bachelors in English I found constantly reading literature and discussing it with peers/writing to be very therapeutic.",

    "Have you heard of the clinical trials for glutamate blockers for schizophrenia.  If I recall glutamate let\u2019s the brain communicate within all its parts and they found a higher level of glutamate receptors in people with schizophrenia.  This over communication could excite other neurotransmitter leading to illness.  The new drug is supposed to improve negative symptoms related to basic functioning rather than positive symptoms like delusion ,hallucinations,etc....in the mean time I tried the cheap supplement theanine which is a natural glutamate blocker from green tea in most grocery stores.  I felt really good immediately after taking it.  It has a calming anti anxiety effect and has good synergy with caffeine.  I believe it naturally promotes gaba while blocking glutamate.  I havnt fact checked this, and it would be better to take a doctors word than mine, but it did somewhat improve my quality of life/ maybe your son would benefit.",
    "I don\u2019t mind at all Thank you",
    "Yes psychosis is a slippery slope because when it is active the afflicted has complete denial or obliviousness that they are dangerously ill.  It has always taken the intervention of medicine and retrospect for me to see the crisis I\u2019m in.  I have to be well/ on meds to understand that the problem is sourced somewhere in me: by my harboring of a disease.  The biggest battle has definitely been myself and I do enjoy that mantra thank you",

I don't understand this reaction but I could spend all day talking to cashiers, I'm sure it freaks out the other people waiting behind me but everybody gets my attention there so it hasn't caused too many problems for me.  \n\nI'm guessing that cashiers get wound-up with the urge to stop the constant flow of non-intimate interaction and I suspect that tension is what triggers my otherwise restrained personality to bloom.  Of course, I've met more than a couple cashiers who respond negatively to me but most of them seem to enjoy the extra attention or at least find me amusing.\n\nYeah, I've also had some life-changing experiences in grocery stores, it's a primal zone in my experience.",

I don\u2019t want to make it sound as if you need to do this otherwise it reflects on you badly, because I understand how it could feel awkward, especially since she didn\u2019t know that you are struggling with suicidal thoughts.

Hopefully your message will cease any further negative comments.",
    "I completely agree with this. The only point being made is that it is not considered equal to physical health. When some mental illnesses are actually more painful than some physical illnesses. It should just be treated equally and taken as seriously, every day. No ones asking anyone to do anything for you besides treat it just as seriously because then that'll create more awareness and understanding and I know just that alone would make my journey dealing with bipolar significantly more easy to endure every day. That's just how I feel. Fine if no one agrees at all",

    "First of all, that's not even my tweet. Secondly, shame on you for spewing your shit ass opinion on such a sensitive subject with clearly very little understanding of the reality of it. Mental illnesses are not treated the same as physical illnesses. They're are people I personally know who don't even think mental illnesses are a real thing. They think it's just made up in the persons head or \"that's just the way they are\". Mental healthcare has always and still is failing to really make a difference. They don't even necessarily know why certain mental illnesses occur still. And finding a good psychiatrist who actually does his job right and accurately diagnoses you and prescribes you the correct medication? Good fucking luck. It's a rotating door of money for the pharmaceutical companies. They aren't even sure what they should prescribe sometimes or what'll help. That's why there's so many different types of antipsychotics and bullshit like that. My biggest personal challenge was finding someone I trusted to even properly diagnose me. One of the main causes of deaths and suicide in those with mental illnesses are misdiagnosis. No ones telling anyone what they should care about. We're just saying it should be taken as seriously as physical illness are all the time and not belittled by people like you.",

    "A request (or short personal story demonstrating the importance) that they consider seeking help from someone who is both trained and experienced in helping people with mental health problems. Growing up I never heard a single thing that was mental health positive or that it was a good idea to see a doctor if you're suffering like that. Instead, the attitude was that even for physical illnesses you should take pride in bearing through the pain and sucking it up. Preventative care wasn't a thing, it was seen as ridiculous to try treating something that wasn't a dire emergency (even if ignoring the problem led to a small problem growing into an expensive and hard to treat problem).\n\n\nFor God's sake, please see a damn therapist or psychiatrist if you're suffering. I needlessly wasted years of my life because of this attitude towards medicine. About privacy - there's no such database that employers can look to see if you are diagnosed. Your medical privacy is considered a very serious thing by the HIPAA. Your friends and employer won't know unless you disclose it yourself. If you're worried about the money - consider how much your income is affected by being too mentally ill to be stably employed or too depressed to apply for a better job or education. Wouldn't your income increase if your mental illness was under control, and wouldn't that offset the cost of doctor appointments and pills?\n\n\nWhile asking a friend what you can do to help them is a good idea I have one caveat. I _dont_ recommend telling people that you will be there to listen to them. True support is encouraging them to start or continue care with professionals, not trying to become their pseudo-therapist. That's more like enabling than helping, and bad experiences can lead them to mistakenly believe that an actual therapist would be as uselessly unhelpful as an unqualified layperson. Similarly, don't give advice about pills other than the minimum \"have you told your psychiatrist about what you're telling/asking me?\"",
    "\"Remember, you don't live in a vacuum. If you're thinking of suicide, be sure to ask friends and family for help getting your final affairs in order first so that they are only left with one mess to clean up.\"",
    "That's understandable. Sometimes you can love people from a distance because you know they're really going through something and there's no longer anything you can do for them and it's becoming toxic for you to be involved in. My best friend since 7th grade completely cut me out of her life because I was going through a really bad toxic manic phase and I ended up getting help and am still getting better and we're right back to where we left off. Perhaps the same will happen for you and your friend. But if not, that's okay too. No matter what someone's going through ultimately whatever they're doing are their choices and if it's not healthy for you then it's not. Sometimes you gotta put you first ",
    "[deleted]",
    "Oh I agree that it should be treated as equally serious. Unfortunately that's hard as hell to accomplish, I think because when people think of mental illness they link it to the personality and not to the brain. They think it's your personality that's messed up, not your physical brain",

Plus I'm clearly no longer engaging in a fight with him. I totally agree with the mods in the mindset that we're \"all in this together\" but sadly, we aren't. And that's clear by other people arguing on this thread as well. It wasn't just us and it's over.",

You could alway recycle the paper after.\n\nOne time I tore an extra book i had. Also if you ever wanna talk just message me. Maybe you're feeling that way again when you want to self harm.

I\u2019ve dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts/attempts for most of my life, but I still don\u2019t know what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d and what\u2019s \u201cget to a hospital, you need intensive care now\u201d. I remember my psychiatrist, when I told him I thought of suicide a lot, he asked me if I had a plan-do I have whatever I plan to use, have I set a date, etc? As low as I felt, he said it wasn\u2019t bad enough to \u201c send me up the hill\u201d to inpatient. Lately it\u2019s been bad tho, I said something to my dr at my last appt, she said it\u2019s just situational cuz my life sucks (my words, not hers), and didn\u2019t seem concerned. I\u2019d say I\u2019m usually between a 7 and a 9, and spend most days around an 8. I just worry about how it\u2019ll affect my nephew, as he\u2019s grown quite attached to me, and is old enough to remember me now. I actually had that exact thought just this week that if a truck was coming towards me I wouldn\u2019t try to move, so that was interesting to see. Sorry my thoughts are all over, my brain isn\u2019t working today. Thanks again.",

    "This is very useful, thanks for sharing.\n\nTwo things I would add:\n\n1) As somebody who has been worse than 8 but didn't quite meet 9 (plan and a method but no fixed date and hadn't acquired my chosen item), 9 looks different to different people. Personally, I didn't have the energy or the ability to care enough to sort out my financial stuff, say goodbye or even write a note. If I had done it, I would've just done it. This is not to say that you have got it wrong - just that there are other perspectives.\n\n2) Secondly, I'd consider the potential problem of people looking at the scale and feeling bad or guilty because they are/were not as close to the actual act as other people. For example, I'm pretty far in my recovery, so I'm able to dismiss the thoughts, but I do still have a kneejerk reaction of 'I'm not as valid because I never made an actual attempt'. Again, I think the merits of your guide exceed this problem, but I thought it'd be good to bring it to your attention anyway.",

And I drove like a complete idiot. My girlfriend was in the car with me, and once I was done driving she started asking me like where I was mentally and why I was so down, and I hadn\u2019t even realized how low I was feeling until she said this and it totally dawned on me that I drive slightly more reckless when I\u2019m down. So now, if I notice myself doing the most while driving or driving a little faster than normal, I breathe and force myself to slow down and play some great music while also paying attention to how I\u2019m feeling mentally and physically and then do what I can to change that for the better",

I have stuff on my mind, but I don\u2019t think of suicide, except when that one weird friend brings up stupid hypotheticals. \n4. Suicide doesn\u2019t occur to me except in moments of frustration or stress. It\u2019s like a weird escape hatch my brain has decided to just go to in an attempt to escape stress. It doesn\u2019t feel serious, it\u2019s almost a joke. \n5. The joke is getting really stale. Suicidal ideation and other intrusive thoughts keep happening, but I am mostly interested in other things. It\u2019s like a low key death affinity. \n6. I am thinking about suicide a lot. It has become troubling. I can distract myself if I really try, however if an out of control semi was headed towards me, I might not move. I am passively suicidal. \n7. I cannot stop thinking about suicide, and unfortunately I cannot distract myself. I might be doing more risky things like driving recklessly or drinking to excess. I have graduated from passively suicidal to having a death wish. I need help. \n8. I am no longer fighting the thoughts, just sort of indulging in them. I sort of want to make the suicide plan, but I am stopping myself. I am holding on, but barely. It isn\u2019t safe for me to be alone. I am suicidal. \n9. I am actively making a plan to end my life.

For us we might make a ptsd/anxiety scale, or a general functionality scale. \n\nBut all of those are different mental health things that affect suicide ideation and suicidal impulses. \n\nWe wanted to be upfront. We wanted to not tap dance around having the conversation. \n\nIt is mental health awareness month. You could just say you saw it and thought it was interesting. Ask them how high they have ever been on the scale? It starts a conversation. \n\nYou might be surprised. Maybe your friends have struggled with this too. \n\nThis scale actually started as a really dark game to get our friend to talk about her suicidal thoughts. We started by rating how high we thought other people had ever been.  Idk it worked. It got her talking. Then we reworked the scale to something more useful and specific.\n\nIt helped get her through some really shit times. \n\nThen, when we were diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, this scale got us through that too. \n\nWe are sort of leap of faith people, but then we have recently gotten used to telling people we are multiple people living in one body. That is not an easy conversation to have. But people, they always surprise us. There are a lot more kind and good hearted ones than there are assholes.\n\nI would say give your friends a chance.

We have been a 9, but too briefly to actually make a plan. \n\nWe could add a \u201cmight\u201d in to the scale for nine. Because that is really what it is. Those are things people might be doing at that spot. The main thing is some sort of preparation is happening. And it could be there isn\u2019t a lot of preparation, and it just goes very quickly from an 8 to a 10, with 9 just being a brief moment of deciding. \n\nI think it would be great is people ended up making modified versions of the scale to suit their needs better, especially if it is something they then share with their therapist and close friends to help them stay safe.\n\nThat\u2019s the big thing for us, the scale is a tool for communicating some really hard things in those moments when it is not easy to communicate at all. That\u2019s how we have used it, how our friends have used it. It have gotten us through a lot. \n\nWe are just really thrilled to see people talking about this, about how bad they have ever gotten, about where they are at now, and really assessing if they need help. Start talking and keep talking, that\u2019s the big goal. \ud83d\udc9b",

We get to live at a 2-3 most days. It is wonderful here. \n\nI don\u2019t want to tell you what to do, but I hope you will get help.   We are not really the right people to actively counsel people. We are many people in one body and half the time those people are sad kids coping with shitty things from our past.

I think some element of planning is required for 9, but it doesn't have to include any of the specific elements mentioned.\n\nAs for the issue with triggering comparisons, it's entirely up to you but I'd personally not try to incorporate it within the scale itself. Rather, I'd either make a new info-comic about how suffering isn't a competition (you could use the example of self-harm scars as well) or write up a brief explanation to accompany the scale on your website.\n\nAlso, just to say - I'm sorry if my previous comment sounded negative.

    "You are okay. We have run into a lot of trauma olympics in our journey towards better mental health and find it generally infuriating. \n\nI understand that that it is something people naturally go to, and I am not sure why.\n\nI don\u2019t think the scale really encourages that thinking unless it is simply the fact that it is a scale, but then there is no real way to avoid that.\n\nBut perhaps a secondary comic talking about the scale could help. We had sort of planned on that since we started illustrating the scale. \n\nI think it is also important to note, it is only a suicide scale, not an emotional pain scale. One does not need to be suicidal to be in pain or to need help. We are pretty miserable. We have been miserable all week. We lost a friend. All our friends are miserable. It just sucks. But we are a 3. We are in a lot of emotional pain, but we are not suicidal. \n\nA person could be a 2 or a 3 on this scale and have other problems, such as depression, anxiety, ptsd, did... that they need help with. Just because one\u2019s brain does not reach for suicide as a weird sort of escape hatch does not mean they don\u2019t still need help.\n\nWe only made the suicide scale because we use it as a tool to keep ourselves and our best friend safe. It has been for us a tried and true stop gap for the dangerous times.  Our only regret is we did not share it sooner and more widely. \n\nWe will probably give ourselves a little time, then we will maybe give a general mental health comic a go. To further explain it, and maybe make more scales and resources for other sorts of mental health problems, a sort of mental health tool kit.  \n\nWe just felt like we had to do the suicide scale right away. Idk that\u2019s what we do with big emotions I guess. We make them into something. \n\nWe will take a break before we start that comic tho. We are pretty busy for the next week and just a little drained in general.\n\n\ud83d\udc9b take care",

There is this odd thing in the universe how your friend showed up that night, and it saved you. When my daughter was 14, she was going through a rough patch. I was keeping a fairly close eye on her, but I had a weekly aerobics class after work. One evening, after I parked my car at the recreation center, something told me to go home immediately. Do not go to aerobics class, something\u2019s wrong. Get home now. I\u2019ve learned to trust my inner voice, so I drove home quickly, I checked on my daughter, and I didn\u2019t sleep all night. I kept watch over her. Next day, I still had that feeling so I called a psych doc friend of mine, and brought my daughter in for a consultation. Oh at the time my daughter was sure she hated me because the doc put her in the hospital. Turns out my daughter told me later on when she stopped hating me, that night she had made a noose and planned to hang herself in the tree. I cannot fathom what would have happened had I not listened to my inner voice. It\u2019s been over 10 years now. Daughter is better. There had been an online predator messing with her mind back then, and she had spun into a deep depression. We reported everything we could but I think he got away with it.",

    "That was a very sad but beautiful story! Well the ending was beautiful is what I mean! I've had that happen to me before where I was contemplating on taking my life and things happened that stopped me from actually planning on doing! Also, I read the comment you posted about how one of the mods in the depression subreddit said this was toxic, don't listen to them! Glad you reposted it here!",
    "Did you talk to him again? I wonder if he was given a sign to talk to you.",
    "Was he trying to work up the courage to tell you that he liked you by driving you around? What did he say when you started sobbing hysterically??",
    "I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t commit suicide. Even though I have thoughts like that sometimes, I tell myself that life is worth living. I\u2019m happy that he stopped by your house before you tried to do it. I\u2019m happy that you seem better now. Stay strong.",
    "Wow, what a heartwarming story. I'm sorry you were raped, that part sucks. It's like this guy was one of your guardians. Very cool. Hope you are well.",
    "Holy shit this played with my emotions. Thank you for sharing this story and I'm so glad that your plans for that night did change. Best of luck for the rest of your goddamn life cause you're gonna have it and that's amazing.",
    "I was in a bad mood until I came across this post and it warmed my heart. Goes to show that for every bad guy, there is a good guy to offset.\n\nI recall when I went through a nasty episode of depression a few years ago, my friend suddenly made a lot of plans with me through that time without knowing I was in a dark place and it prevented me from being left with my own mind for the most part. Makes you question if the universe wanting you alive or something.\n\nI'm glad you're still with us in the fight in this weird game called life. ;)",
    "Thank you for sharing this... <3",
    "Perhaps he had a gut instinct about you and followed it. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re ok now.",
    "Thank you for sharing this. Sometimes we don't think that what we are experiencing internally is perceivable to others, but (maybe) thankfully he was able to see that you were not okay and needed a bit of company at that moment. \n\nWe tend to underestimate the power of human contact, warmth, and company. I'm glad he didn't hold back and that you accepted to take that ride with him.",
    "I am so proud of you. \u2764\ufe0f",
    "That's an incredible story. Sounds to me like this person might have realized something was going on with you. Are they still in your life?\n\nAlso, you are so strong for living through that experience. And I'm sorry that you suffered like that.",
    "He could probably see it in your eyes and hear it in your voice that you'd given up. He sounds like a great guy and I'm glad you made it. <3",
    "I may be saying something someone else has already said, but I think he knew.\n\nWhat if he texted you first, OP, and got a bad feeling when he saw the message didn\u2019t deliver? Even if you not responding wasn\u2019t that uncommon, a message being undelivered is generally strange when it happens for an extended period of time. So he thought of an excuse to come check on you, remembering the conversation about the Pok\u00e9mon cards, and bought them to come and give to you. Maybe? \n\nEither way, I\u2019m sure he knew, and I agree with the others here. You guys deserve each other, deserve happiness and love. This story is so amazing and wonderful, and brought me to tears. Thank you for sharing!",
    "How did he know?",
    "Wow, that\u2019s actually a pretty nice story. My attempt landed me in a ward",
    "This brought me to tears. I\u2019m so glad he stepped in and you\u2019re still here. I\u2019m sorry for what happened to you. \u2764\ufe0f",
    "that's an incredible story. it's amazing how something so simple can mean so much",
    "I'm crying and I'm glad you're here.\n\nDo you still talk to him?",

    "The angels visit when you least expect.",
    "Yo, this dude... Keep him around if you can my friend.",
    "I'm bawling. Thank you for sharing your story. It helps.",
    "Wow, you made me cry. It's crazy how beautiful and powerful a silent connection with someone is. Your friend didnt speak, but he obviously knew something was wrong and wanted to try his best at cheering you up. Count yourself lucky to have a friend so caring. Glad you're still here, OP. You should thank your friend in a way rhats comfortable for you, even if it's just another drive that you organise. You dont need to necessarily tell him Thanks, but it's nice to have that feeling of gratitude and peace.",
    "I think of myself as a strong man, but I'll be dammned if this didnt make my heart warm. I'm so happy you stayed. I'm so happy you're alive. Please keep living, you're strong enough to make it through anything.",
    "I don\u2019t know if this has already been said but I think it\u2019s worth letting you know either way. \n\nYou likely helped that man just as much as he helped you. \n\nGuys, especially those who are depressed, deal with their issues in ways that may often seem odd to others. Growing up, guys are taught to \u201cbe a man\u201d and thus don\u2019t really know how to talk about things. \n\nBut the thing is, often times just being with someone and doing something mindless can really help. Him just driving around, getting gas, and not talking, was likely his method of calming himself down and dealing. Often times the simple act of NOT thinking about an issue can go a long way.\n\nSo just like him driving around with you kept you from doing something terrible, you just spending time with him likely kept him from doing something very similar.",
    "how did he know?",
    "This is amazing! I hope you feel much better now. Im so annoyed that noone would listen to you and be kind when you experienced such a horrid thing.",
    "Dhk\u00e5segc\u00e5jnb5hnyf damn this makes me feel fucking pathetic for wanting to kill myself",
    "This is why it's important for girls especially to be extremely careful and not put themselves in compromised situations where this could happen (isolated). No one is blaming OP but im sure she is loads more cautious, had she been before she mightve been able to avoid what unfortunately happened to her. Its not her fault the man did that but she did have control over how and where they interacted and sadly at the time chose the wrong way.",
    "he knew. i dont know how but thats not a random act of kindness, thats the act of a man who knew he had to save the life of somebody he cared about. whoever he is, theyre an absolute legend. glad youre still with us op, the world is a better place with you here!",
    "Thank you for your kind words. \n\nIt would be a lie if I said every day is easy, but that night was the final time I ever allowed myself to put a suicide plan into effect. \n\nMy perspective on life (and death) shifted that night. No matter how bad it gets, someone out there, even if it is not who you expect, cares. I think it is because of that notion that I have found the will to carry on.",
    "My heart aches when I hear that someone can relate to me in that way. I hope you are doing better, and I hope that, when you are comfortable, you will be able to face what happened to you head-on, with no fear and no shame. I cannot speak for your parents, but I know that foreign culture is just so drastically different and despite their ignorance towards these sort of things, I want to believe that they don\u2019t mean ill. I understand first-hand how the shame and pain of being abused weighs on you. You are so much more than what happened to you. We may not know one another, but we are bonded over our similar experience and the fact that we are survivors.",
    "I was disappointed, as well. I reached out, asking if I could repost, and was told that the story was \u201ctoxic\u201d and had no place in their subreddit. \n\nI never meant to offend anyone by sharing my experience. Hopefully it will be better received here! Thank you for your words.",
    "i wonder how he figured it out tho.. im glad he did.",
    "I never disclosed any sort of personal struggle to him (or anyone, really). I am thankful for whatever compelled him to come to my home that night. I cannot help but believe it was some sort of intuition that something was not right. But even if it was just a coincidence, I still view the story with the same fondness.",
    "I think some people can. Around this time last year, I was going to die by suicide. Right before I left my house to drive to the park where I planned to overdose, I sent a one-sentence email to a previous therapist, simply saying, \u201cThanks for being a great therapist.\u201d We had ended our working relationship amicably two years before and were only in contact a few times since, and although we worked together for almost a decade, I wouldn\u2019t have described myself as one of her favorite clients or anything. Anyway, she called me within five minutes of me sending it. She spent an hour and a half speaking to me on the phone, coaxing me off the proverbial ledge.",
    "We are still friends. After that day, I made a much more active effort to be as good of a friend to him, as he was to me. He has become one of the closest people in my life. For his birthday a few months ago, I got him $100 worth of Pok\u00e9mon cards. He deserves all of the Pok\u00e9mon cards in the world, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\nHe still does not know. I think that I am waiting for the correct time to disclose that sort of thing to him. I get very excited/nervous when I imagine the conversation.",
    "Oh wow, stories like this give me absolute chills. I believe some things occur that are so beyond our realm of comprehension. Intuition, gut feelings, whatever you would like to call it, like you had, seem so miraculous. \n\nI am so glad you listened to whatever it was that was telling you to go home. I am so glad that your daughter is better. And I am so glad that I had the privilege of reading this story.\n\nThank you so much for sharing.\n\nStories like this restore my faith in humanity, and make me believe in something bigger.",
    "When it happens, I will absolutely include an update. I appreciate the excitement you have towards this! Thank YOU for the kind words",
    "Good bot",
    "He is one of my closest friends, to date :-)",
    "Hmm, maybe. I don\u2019t think so, however. He didn\u2019t seem nervous, or that he was looking to have a conversation. He just seemed to want to get me out of my house and distract me; hence, lulling me to sleep in his car. He hasn\u2019t expressed any interest, and it\u2019s been years since.\n\nWhen I cried, he said, \u201cLet it all out.\u201d and kept driving. He asked if he could rest his hand on mine, as he was driving as a form of consoling me. I said yes, despite being terrified by male touch. Something in me told me I could trust him. He then simply kept driving.",
    "Aw man, I\u2019m sorry to hear. How are you doing now at least?",
    "Happy cake day stranger.",
    "I know you didn't intend for this to victim blame, but this is how the rape culture ends up blaming the victim instead of the perpetrator. It's true that women should be cautious given the state of rape culture, but it is not their responsibility to fix it. That has to be up to men to decide that they must not allow assault and teach others not to allow it either.",
    "I disagree with this sentiment entirely. \n\nYes, it was being alone with a man that led to my assault. However, had I not allowed myself to be \u201cisolated\u201d with a man the night I planned to kill myself, I would not be here today.\n\nSame situation: alone in a car, at night, with a man. Two different outcomes. \n\nPeople who rape will find a way to rape. People who don\u2019t rape will not rape. Simple.",

    "Thank you for your kind words.  This happened to be 16 years ago, and I went through DBT therapy, it was hard but it helped a lot.  Through the years my Dad has realized that it was not my fault and so forth, but it took a lot of time for us to get that \u201crespect\u201d back.  It\u2019s definitely hard being from immigrant backgrounds with very old school ideology.  I am glad to be a survivor and just like you, glad that we are making a negative into something positive by talking about what happened to us.  By being survivors our stories may help someone else who may need to feel accepted or like they can relate too! \u2764\ufe0f",
    "Toxic? It seemed super well-received. It got taken down at over 500 up-votes. I am sorry that someone labeled your experience as that. You have certainly touched my heart. I see nothing toxic about you speaking your truth. Keep speaking it. Much love.",
    "How is this toxic? It\u2019s a beautiful story of growth and human kind. Are they only wanting people to post negative stuff, like that isn\u2019t toxic? I kind of want to message the mods and tell them how disappointing that is tbh..",
    "Do you have a record of that message? Maybe PM a few other mods the exchange + share the deleted post. If somebody is doing this sort of thing on a MH subreddit, he isn't doing his job properly",

    "Sometimes people we don't realize care deeply about us are much quicker to notice when we're not ourselves. It could be that he's just very empathetic, or he may have noticed subtle shifts in OP -- slower response times to texts or noticeably altered syntax, or if he saw her a few times between when she was assaulted and that night perhaps there was something in her expression. Whatever the case, when she didn't respond to his texts his instinct was check on her, and because he cares about her when she opened the door he saw that she was in distress, so he did what he could: he offered her his time with no conditions upon it, to talk or just be with someone until she was okay. I can only hope that everyone in a similar situation has at least one perceptive friend like that.",
    "Some people just have that high level of empathy.\n\nIf you guys usually texted and you respond quickly, maybe you not responding concerned him. Whatever the case I believe once he saw you, he knew something was wrong. He may not have known how dire the situation is but he knew you needed a distraction.\n\nBut all that aside, I, for one, am glad he was there for you. I've had a similar experience with someone saving me in a similar way. And being male, there's a good chance I'll never know the pain that led you to that moment, but I'm glad he was there, and that you're here to share this story.\n\nYou are loved OP.",

I was very taken aback when I reached out to their mods and asked what I could change in order to make the story suitable enough to not to be taken down, and was met with this reply: \u201cNothing [can be changed to make it suitable]. The entire story is toxic because of its uplifting nature.\u201d I tried to explain that people seemed super receptive to it, but the same mod told me that \u201cpopular does not equate to non-toxic.\u201d Though from the comments, it appeared that many people appreciated my story. No one seemed angry or harmed by it.\n\nI understand that the subreddit is meant for conversations about depression, etc. But that was MY experience with depression. Apparently I was not valid in their community because I was able to overcome one suicidal episode. \n\nI am really glad that I am not alone in my bafflement over this.

Yeah, well, if you didn\u2019t show up, I wouldn\u2019t have made it through the night.\u201d I feel like I am going to spend the rest of my life repaying him for what he did for me. He definitely deserves more than words for what he did.\n\nI actually plan to get us tickets to Japan so we can go visit the Pok\u00e9mon Center in Tokyo for his birthday next year. I think in the envelope with the plane tickets I might include a letter disclosing what he did for me...something along the lines of, \u201cI know I can never repay you for what you unknowingly did.

I told her I was fine and that I loved her and tried to get off the phone but she asked me to bring her food (at the time we lived 30 minutes apart). She wouldn't let me hang up until I promised to bring her food. For a long while she was the only person in my life who cared about me. My own mother and father didnt even call me for my birthday. My dad I understand because he is in poor health and declining by the day but it hurt.\n\nBut I digress. She stayed on the phone with me while I went to Wendy's and then drove to her house.

Something like listening to my favourite song or eat some nice breakfast or take a hot shower, whatever makes you happy. It doesn't have to be anything big or take a lot of time, but it really helps me to know that the first thing I get to do in the morning is a happy thing. I hope this helps you a little too.

    "Happening right now. I'm inclined to think it's our bodies telling us that this life isn't for us. We probably shouldn't be dreading another day of work or school or whatever. We probably should be waking up with the sun, feeling our bare feet on the ground, experiencing the earth we take up residency in. We ignore everything and focus on being in these four walled rooms, large or small, dealing with problems that have zero meaning to us in reality. Generally all problems stemming back to money. Work is only stressful because everybody needs to keep working so no money is lost. It's like the earth outside doesn't exist at all. No wonder we dread every new day. We're not living it naturally, not even close to it. \n\nDamn, i didn't mean for the hippie rant. Just really going through it right now, philosophizing life too much. Ready to just drop it all and walk away, even if I will live a poor life not belonging to anyone or anywhere, even if I'll struggle to support myself with food and water and heat.

The same with food, not now, but from time to time, I just kinda don't eat, it's pretty weird.",

I\u2019m constantly tired from vivid dreams, twitching, shouting, hearing screams in my head, and other random weirdness that my brain likes to throw at me. \n\nWhen I get to the morning, I then procrastinate about getting up, as once I do the day starts. \n\nSometimes it feels like there\u2019s no end.",

It affected me hearing it from him for some reason. Now i have melatonin and find i can no longer pull all nighters. Generally speaking i feel much less like shit in the morning.",
    "The only bit that doesn't affect me at the moment is the having to get up - I'm at the point where if I don't get up til 1pm, then I don't get up til 1pm, but that's only because pandemic and not having anything I need to wake up for most of the time. \n\nI find it extremely hard to go to bed before 1.30, 2am and if I do have to or want to try, I end up stressing myself out and just crying for no reason. I USED to do it as a kid and teen because I was afraid I wouldn't wake up again, and would often go to school on just 3 hours of sleep (I couldn't bring myself to not sleep at all bc anxiety).\n\nI actually want a tattoo of a toppled over hourglass, because I've wished for time to pause so often, and I realised that a sideways hourglass is the same shape as the infinity symbol.

    "I like your analogy but i think drugs are a bit different from depression. The way i look at it emotions are no different from sensations like pain and hot and cold telling you somethings wrong. Emotions are signals. When your angry its your body telling you theres something in your life that needs to change immediately, thats why the adrenaline from it gives you all that energy. When your depressed its your body telling you that even though you are stuck something still needs to change, thats why depression is such an uncomfortable feeling. Most peoples' responses to depression is unfortunately wallowing in your feelings, because they dont realise that the emotion is designed to make it too uncomfortable to keep living your life the way you are. Some people, because they dont understand this, decide to stop living all together.",
    "Theres this awesome quote i found yesterday that relates to the \"rather you want to kill something inside of yourself\":\n\nIf you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you. -Gospel of Thomas",
    "I dont think the drug analogy fits, let me tell you why and you can decide for yourself. Emotions are just chemical signals in our brain right. Like dopamine and serotonin. Well, in depression its more so just the person going through a really shit time in life, and the emotions are telling them that. Nothings out of order there. Drugs on the other hand are chemicals themselves and act directly on the chemicals dopamine and serotonin in our brain. So whether taking them is good or bad, we're going to be feeling good either way.",

    "Excellent question. I cant say for sure, but I will take a shot...  \n\n\nThe animal instinct, that is survival, has been around much longer than any desire to not survive. For example, lets look a anxiety. What is it, exactly? It is a response in the body to stress. If you see a predator coming after you, you either run  stand and fight, all this has become part of instinct.  We no longer have to worry much  about predators, as we once did. However, we still have that instinct. Why is this? Because it helped us to survive long ago, evolution left us with it.    \n\n\n  \nThe mental health crisis we have today is nothing new, its something which we have a difficult time understanding.  We lived a great deal longer in small tribes, worrying about basic survival, than we have as we live today. Think of it in terms of a computer, or any machinery which uses programming. We have the same hardware, as well as software, yet we live in a much different world. Also consider that we live now in the \"information age\". Human beings are processing maniacs; we suck in billions of bits of data every second, most of which subconsciously.   \n\n\nThe tl;dr version is that we are an ancient species which descends from survivors. Our ancestors fought like hell to survive, and we, today, are not much different. Only, again, we have these stresses which work against us.   \n\n\nI hope that explains a bit of what you asked. I could go into greater detail. It is good to research this type of thing, because, well, understanding human nature is a great survival tool, like a guide book. We are an old species, but we are still infants when it comes to understanding who we are and how we work. Consider that we have been in our current form for approx 250,000 years. Most of that time we spent just surviving. Today, how we live, tat is what I meant when I said we are like infants, we are just learning to understand who we are, and how to deal with our minds.",
    "I cannot say I agree with the idea of wanting to die. People hurt not to die, they hurt to live. The mental pain we feel is us fighting the urge to end it, think about that.",
    "Hmmmm you have a point but that's not easily available",
    "It depends. But do it will you know what you are doing, not on impulse.",
    "I certainly agree with that. Rather well explained. I've heard the whole bit about anxiety just being a flight or fight response.",
    "Well yes, a few choose to do that instead of actually.. Kicking the bucket if you will.",
    "Wow that's Intense. And hit me harder that the other way of thinking,  yet I agree with both ideas. That's the hardest part of wanting to die and not wanting to live is being afraid of dying and equally afraid of living with either pain.",
    "True",
    "Well, thats geared more towards a panic attack, in my estimation. A panic attack, as you may well know, is generally not long lasting, but very terrifying.   \n\n\nEverything we go through is such cases may be a combination of many different things, such as past events/trauma, diet and exercise etc. Many people count out the last two, but what I think is, perhaps, some forget that we are a very complex system, and everything works in conjunction with one another.  If one of these are out of whack, its safe to assume the entire system is going to be effected in some way.  But even if one gets a work out every now and again, eats properly, gets plenty of sun (vitamin d), things can still go wrong.  \n\n\nWe have, what, 250 billion or so neurons in our brains, and 10,000 or so connections between each neuron? Taking that into consideration, its easy to see that something is going to go wrong eventually.",
    "Sure, that happens. My point was that they do fight. But sometimes the desire to live is outweighed by the desire to not suffer.  If one wishes to not hurt, they want to feel better. There is no possibility of relief if we are not here to experience.   \n\n\nWhen I went through it, I told myself that in order to feel good, I must be able to feel. It was never easy, not one day in over 4 years. All but , maybe 1, when I was manic for the first time. That is when I felt more alive than I ever have. Having experienced that manic state, I have come to realize, being manic, that it was simply my state of mind that caused me  to feel that good. It gave me hope when I was ready to end my life.   \n\n\nEveryone in my life looked down on me, it was extremely lonely. I am certain the total numbness I felt was my minds way of protecting itself/me.  Its sounds off, talking as if my brain and I were separate, but you get the idea.",
    "Nobody wants to die, as I said, we want to live. The urge to continue is instinct. If someone wanted to actually die, they would end it, period. It takes a tremendous amount of strength to not actually end it, and to endure the pain, we all understand that on some level.",
    "I weirdly enough do. I like the bit about having the mindset because I feel like that can set the tone for soo many things. Whether you're feeling depressed, manic etc.\nHowever I do wonder the struggle of like trying to feel happy when you're depressed. Like do you think it can just be altered by mindset",

    "Honestly for many people Reddit might be a good place to start. It certainly helped me when I was last suicidal. There are some incredibly helpful people in this sub (and in r/SuicideWatch) who will take a lot of time to listen and give some input. Personally I\u2019ve been through this enough times to know when I need professional help, when I need my friends to help me and also when I just need to express my thoughts to vent a bit, without upsetting anyone or making people worry. Sometimes I just want no-one from my real life involved, but instead just need to write stuff down and get some feedback to sort of get a grip of reality.\n\nBut of course, if you are in serious danger then Reddit is not much other than a place for immediate support. You should still talk to professionals.",

The pain is a natural part in the cycle of suffering sudden death brings on. Every wave of grief and anger is normal to struggle with and some strange unusual emotions may get tossed in as well.\n\nNow is the time to seek consolation and lean on your support systems, now is the time to enroll in therapy to help you heal so that you have the tools to help your children heal.\n\nOf course finances are a big worry, even if she didn\u2019t have a life insurance policy I\u2019m sure your family can help stabilize things until the next best option becomes apparent.\n\nI know we live in a world where money is king but prioritize your emotional health and that of your kids for right now, don\u2019t let them see your fear of the future. It\u2019s ok for them to know how grieved you are over how much you loved her but they need to feel stability in their home life even if that means moving around a bit.\n\nThe present feels like the worst possible thing that could ever happen has happened, you\u2019ll be the strongest you\u2019ve ever been emotionally after working through this. And even though it sounds crazy to even consider at this point you will find someone to share affection with who can help you coparent again.\n\nThe love and memories that you shared with her are eternal and can\u2019t ever be disrupted just because your story with her was cut short. You will always have the early chapters to reread and there will be new chapters to write even if that answer isn\u2019t satisfying because you want and miss that person.\n\nLove is an infinite resource, take advantage of the other sources of love in your life and give it freely, as frightening as it may be you can never lose it. \n\nEverything will be ok even if it isn\u2019t right now, reach out if you need to talk\n\nEdit: I know you\u2019re worried for money but your emotional, mental and spiritual health take precedence- if you need a free resource the crisis text line is equipped to help sort through wild emotions BEFORE they turn into a crisis point at 741741",

I know you are so far from thinking about this now but if you eventually start looking to date again, make sure your children are the priority. Honestly if they do not like your girlfriend or there is the slightest hint she is a jealous person please believe your children. There are plenty others out there. \n\n2. Lean on your family for support and be open about your emotions. Don't try and bottle them up or suppress or act like you're fine, because you're not. \n\n3. See a therapist. This is very important. Also get your kids a therapist too.",

The problem is that they are expensive, and as you mentioned you are financially concerned.  I am sorry.  Please do not be afraid to ask for help from anyone one of us, ok?  Please remember that!",
    "I'm so sorry for your loss. \nI don't know how much of help I can be but if you need some emotional and spiritual guidance (that can also help you with the money situation), I would recommend you to read the book \" Letting Go:. A pathway to surrender\" by David R. Hawkins- I've been using it and have found it even more helpful than therapy and it has made me pretty self sufficient when I was recovering from depression and anxiety and saved me a lot of money. It talks about the processing of grief by helping the reader ask some bold self discovery related revealing questions to self to healthily process emotions. \n\nNext, I think this would really help you:  check out the book/documentary on Netflix: The Secret.  And then to implement it you'll need to check out r/AllIsMind . This could help w the money situation.",

You are never alone. To share just one similar story: a friend from my high school class got cancer and passed away at 24, leaving behind his wife and beautiful baby girl. Sometimes stories are just cut short, and we have to do our best to re-write the ending we had envisioned. When you feel alone that is the time to reach out, do not feel as though you need to hide yourself. Your grieving process deserves to be heard and felt fully, so that you can begin to heal. \n\nYou worry about your children, this is a very traumatic time in their life, but you will get through this together. Lean on whatever support systems you have: are your parents close by? Do you have any nearby friends? Could your neighbors come give a hand? I know you want to close yourself off, probably the last thing you want is to open your heart and home to people giving you alien looks. But people are willing and wanting to help. The phrase \"it takes a village\" was invented for just this purpose, you do not need to do this alone. Some ideas might be: pre-made meals, video call movie night with neighborhood kids, visits from grandparents. They're pretty young but what about school programs or clubs? Your kids just lost a huge relationship in their life, the best thing you can do right now is fill their time with other smaller relationships. I know the pandemic is still going on, so I'm sorry that I can't offer more ideas here. \n\nSee if you can find a community/therapy specific to you. Right now the most important thing is your mental health, you may think it's your children but how are you supposed to provide for them if your gas tank is empty? You can't be a giver if you have nothing to give. Take care of yourself, even if it's just 10 minutes in the morning to grieve completely by yourself, your mental health will be that much better for it. \n\nI know it isn't what you want to think about right now but there is a future, a bright future, ahead of you. You and your kids have so much left to do and so many plans to fulfill. Plans and ideas that you made with your wife may feel like they'll never happen now, but they absolutely still can, and this is just one way you can keep her memory alive. This darkness will pass over, and someday you'll be able to smile at your wife's memory. You and your kids are going to be ok.",

    "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nI was drawn to your post, as my mother died suddenly 3 years ago. My dad and I experienced the tragedy together, and I always worried and still do about what he\u2019s feeling. \n\nGrief is a terrible rollercoaster ride that never lets you get off. Time does help a little, but that loss is not something that can be replaced. \n\nI moved hundreds of miles away from my hometown after my mother\u2019s death because of the exact reason you talk about. Myself or my dad and I couldn\u2019t go anywhere without people staring at us like we were sad stray animals. Everyone knew and loved my mom. I couldn\u2019t go to the store, work, or the dentist without someone coming up and crying and wanting to pry into what happened. \n\nI felt like an alien too and I know my dad did. Experiencing such a sudden and tragic loss makes you feel like you\u2019re on another planet where time doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nI would have never survived my mother\u2019s death without my dad. We were always close, but he\u2019s truly my best friend and we leaned on each other a lot in the first year. I was 22, so I was able to be there for him. I can\u2019t imagine how you must feel going through this with young children. \n\nThere\u2019s no guide to how to navigate this. You and your children will find a way to heal or at least manage so you can continue your lives. I really encourage you to take time for yourself and letting yourself remember your wife and laugh, cry, and feel for her and the baby. You sound like an amazing father. This will feel dark for a long time, but finding joy in little things (something as small as seeing a kid at the park flying a kite with his grandfather) got me through some pretty low points. \n\nYou and your children will come out of this and you will be ok again some day.",

With the father being so young and having her for support, now not knowing what to do, they're going to need another family member to make things right. \n\nIt's a painful process and it is a shame that the things in the world have in this way... But life is always changing and evolving and we must make the best of it. it sucks that sometimes after a traumatic event happens, you need to look for things to make yourself secure like starting over. Yet, it is imperative that one also makes lots of time to grieve, because the things in the past are not any less special even if they are gone now.",

    "I think it's okay for now, because being with you and acting younger probably makes her feel safe.\n\nJust make sure you're not leaning on her for emotional support and making her feel like you *need* her company.\n\n Ex: it's okay to spend a lot of time together, tell her you're feeling sad (followed by reassurance that you are okay/it's normal to feel sad after something like this) and to deviate from normal routines. \n\nBut it's not okay if she feels like your sadness/grief is her responsibility and it's her job to make you feel better. Or if she feels obligated to take on the role her mom played in the house.\n\nBasically, you want to make sure she knows that even though things are hard and life is changing, her job is still just to be a kid and that she can still lean on you. \n\nShe may feel like she needs to be strong and take care of you and her brother (this is the case with a lot of kids), and it may be easy to let that happen right now because you do need support, but then she's going to withhold her pain to protect you. And that will take a toll on her.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

When I told him this via email, asking for any suggestions, he responded with \"ok thanks\". \n\nNow I realize that I shouldn't expect a paid professional to do anything for free, but you would think the human side of someone would poke through a little bit with some advice or well wishes. Or you know, at least make it look like you actually read past the part where I said I couldn't afford him. But yeah, that response made me realize he didnt care about me past my co pay.

    "I agree with what others have posted so far - sorry you had to hear that.  $100 a week is a LOT.  Obviously your mental health is important, but her beside manner needs serious work.  If she was just trying to give you \"tough love\", then I'd say she missed the mark.  I'd be upset, too.\n\nOn a practical note, I'd ask if there are any group therapy session you can join?  The cost of mental health care is ridiculous (insurance is certainly at fault here), and this kind of care is so badly needed by so many people.  I believe that any practitioner serious about helping as many people as possible should try to look into offering group sessions - again, hopefully it can be navigated with insurance.  Group therapy sessions would help you to split the cost with others, and you can learn a lot from hearing how other people are approaching their issues.  It might also lead to breakthroughs quicker.

    "I got very depressed in college and thought I'd give the university therapy services a try. My first time with a therapist. I had a few sessions and over the course of them explained how my depression was keeping me from doing things. Normal things, chores, work, even things I liked. Basically I needed help addressing these issues because I couldn't bring myself to go to class and I was at risk of dropping out. One day I missed our appt. I was in bed. I just couldn't, you know, pick myself up that day. I quickly get an email saying this is my one warning and if I miss another session without notice I'll have to pay and will not be able to continue with them. I was very angry and hurt. I didn't WANT to cancel and I thought this would be the one person to understand why I might miss a session sometimes or be late. Yet her response was not forgiving at all and I felt so betrayed. After that I expressed myself and left them feedback explaining why I was so upset and would not be back. No response from them at all. Idk I guess that's just disappointing to me.\n\nAnyway, I think it's totally understandable for you to be upset.

I'm in Canada, dunno where you are, but even here it's so hard to afford/have time for/have energy for/have transportation to/just everything\n\nI REALLY liked this doctor she was always so nice, but after college, I had no insurance and glasses are pricey so I made do for 4 years with glasses that weren't quite right.\nThe secretary made a comment that I'd waited too long to do a check up when I went in, and I plainly told her \"I had no insurance, I couldn't afford the expense, so I had to wait\" I was pretty proud as I am extremely non confrontational so this was a lot for me. After my check up, I'm back at the desk, and her and my doctor very obviously raise their voices and start joking about how I'd \"waited so long there's such a big change in your eyesight, wow FOUR years can't wait that long hahahaha NEVER let your prescription lapse, why would you DO that hahaha\" everyone was staring at me so I just loudly stated \"I was poor and uninsured. I only came in because now I'm insured\" they didn't care, I'm still baffled and never going back",
    "Sorry for your experience. \n\nOk so here are the tips I\u2019ve gotten from every therapist I\u2019ve seen for many years. And these are pretty much consistent no matter what\u2019s going on with you.\n-exercise: you don\u2019t have to go hard even if it\u2019s just a walk\n-hydrate and eat nutritious meals: your brain is a machine and needs the right fuel\n- sleep: an absolute must! Not taking naps through the day because that\u2019ll fuck up your sleep schedule. But actually set a sleep schedule and practice good sleep hygiene. (Google if you don\u2019t know, it\u2019ll be a list of tips/do\u2019s&donts) \n-journaling: I hate journaling but it is good and every therapist recommend it to me. It doesn\u2019t have to be a set amount of time or particular subject. I really suck at it and don\u2019t do it everyday but really try to set aside some time everyday to journal. It\u2019s just a good way to put thoughts on paper and kind of releases them from your head instead of just having them bottled up and swirling around. One of my therapist wanted me to write one good thing that happened or one thing I was grateful for each day. Just to break up the negativity and show not everything is bad and this isn\u2019t the worst. So even something small, example: your having what you feel the worst day ever is. You can say hey at least I haven\u2019t stubbed my toe today that\u2019s a plus. So even the smallest thing counts. \n\nSome things I\u2019ve done when I had a lapse in therapy:\n- online resources: there\u2019s a lot of therapist that are on YouTube that have a whole Bunch of content. From explaining conditions, to coping skills, breathing exercises, ect. Just don\u2019t get stuck in the rabbit hole of self diagnosing with every condition lol that\u2019s like webmd. \nOne I watch is Kati Morton. Honestly I just like how she normalizes mental health issues and she talks in a way where you don\u2019t feel guilty or bad for your feelings. \nAlso CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) helps me a lot with my illness. So you could look into if that\u2019s something you\u2019d like. Honestly it\u2019s just a healthy way of thinking for anyone not just people with mental health issues. You can find YouTube channels and workbooks online for this.\n\nLocal support groups, even online a lot are free. A lot of people are turned off of group therapy/ support groups I was too. But I tried and gave is a few trys and found I loved it. So I definitely suggest at least trying it. Usually you can just observe for the first few sessions and then once you get comfortable you can start sharing if you want. \n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of at the moment. I know it\u2019s not a fix or equal to having a therapist but I wanted to give you some realistic and hopefully helpful alternatives. I\u2019ve used these when I have a lapse in care and they helped me. \u2764\ufe0f",

Come on... /s \n\n\nJokes aside, I know 2 countries in South America (brasil and argentina) that have free sessions on colleges with last years students supervised by a teacher. (And they are 3 world countries). Also there is therapy and psychiatrist on the public health system there.\n\nUnfortunately it takes time to get the first appointment and it's not super convenient like a payed one, but it's better than nothing.\n\n\nAlso in Ireland there are places with free and cheap therapy for poor people. \n\nAre also some online therapy that is super cheap... \n\n\nMaybe you can find something like that in your country. I hope you can find something or someone who can help you via video therapy. \n\n\nIf not, therapy is really good, but if you want to get better and you can't pay for it, there are plenty of free things and exercises that you can do. \n\n\nAnd having someone that you can talk to, even if you don't know the person, already helps you because when you say things out loud you can see them differently and get new ideas. \n\nThere are online communities where you ask someone to be your diary and you text them or send audios to them everyday and you can chose between them not saying anything or getting a advice. \n\nI had one +10years ago and it was good. \nI took some time to focus on the stuff that I was saying (no music, movie or something that can distract me around) and I would hear my stuff and think about everything.  \n\nBest of luck.",

Burns was basically the grandfather of CBT, which there's a good chance would be the method a therapist would use on your anyway if depression is your issue.  Which is not to say that a therapist wouldn't help, but this book might be a good stopover until you can get that together.\n\nAnother option to look into is university therapy.  At my local state university, the psychology department offers extremely low therapy rates (like $10-$25).  The only trade off is that your therapist would be a PhD candidate and so wouldn't have the long term experience of a therapist.  This can be a good thing too, as they're very up to date with the latest research.  Also, at least in Colorado, they have to be supervised by a licensed therapist.\n\nThis was the route that I took. Started with that book and eventually did university therapy.  It's been many years since I stopped therapy and tbh, life is pretty good.",

    "You\u2019d be surprised. They might not treat it \u201cbetter\u201d but they don\u2019t have these crazy waitlists Americans have been lied to about. We assume when people from other countries complain about the wait that 1) they are waiting longer than we Americans are (they aren\u2019t typically), that most of their citizens can\u2019t just access private care like we can *if we can pay for it* - it\u2019s just that low income people don\u2019t have to go through what OP describes, and 3) that they pay more (their taxes are about equal to our premiums and cost of care, and are progressively taxed at higher/lower levels depending on patient income). Mainly the time complaint is one I hear a lot - a Brit will whine that the NHS gave them an appointment a month or two out, but my dr does the same to me even when I have private insurance I pay through the nose for. Socialized medicine typically places a longer wait on people with issues that are \u201coptional\u201d to solve (like a bunion removal rather than a broken bone) while in the US the price you pay tends to have more of an impact on how fast you receive care, unless you are actively bleeding out in an ER. Lastly, higher quality of care because drs and nurses aren\u2019t exhausted/busy from having to constantly chart everything specifically for insurance purposes (rather than charting for medical safety, which they would always need to do) and adds a SHITLOAD of unnecessary costs to the backend of medical treatment as hospitals and drs try to recoup their costs from insurance companies who\u2019d rather not pay for it.\n\nI\u2019ve come to this conclusion after hearing from my friends and family members who have experience with both styles of medical systems and who have been nurses/drs in both systems (lots of foreign cousins who went into medicine, experienced US, canadian, Australian, British, and Netherlands healthcare systems), as well as a handful of people who have done backend insurance coding/charting. All my cousins who have practiced medicine in both systems happily earn less in Socialized medicine countries because it\u2019s less stressful. 100% of cousins who needed medical treatment and grew up in US as well as The cousins who grew up in socialized medicine countries steadfastly agree that the socialized version is better all around. When I look at how in debt two of them would\u2019ve been if treated for their issues (one horrific car crash, one autoimmune) they\u2019d be sealed for debt for the rest of their lives. Instead they are comfortably healed up and able to do luxurious things like travel and buy a home rather than rent. Meanwhile I\u2019m pissing away 12,000 a year on health insurance AND spending roughly 5000 on meds a year AND another 10 grand for therapy/psychiatry. My body is a bit of a mess, but I\u2019m not that special. My friends who work in the us healthcare system describe it as trying to plug a bullet wound with a bandaid, it just doesn\u2019t work - the problem immediately overwhelms the solution, the patient gets inadequate care and sent off with a staggering bill. That isn\u2019t what they got into medicine for. They are so burnt out knowing they could provide better care if money and complex insurance documenting wasn\u2019t an issue (they also have more nurses to provide better care, but I digress...)\n\nAnyways, packing up my soapbox.

    "I'm an afghanistan vet. I tell you this because you are feeling the very same way I felt when I came home. So if its ok, I'd like to offer you my advice on trauma. \n\nYou need to know that your experience was terrifying. Earth-shattering. World-rocking and security-robbing and you're now asking yourself questions that nobody should have to ask themselves, ever. I want you to know that nothing that happened is your fault. You aren't to blame.  You're not a bad person for surviving. You don't have a thing to feel guilty for in all of this, so try not to. I know it's hard. Think of guilt like a heavy weight. This weight is not yours to carry. Try not to carry it too long.\n\nRight now, how you feel is raw and new, like a broken bone. Only so much worse. But, just like a broken bone, it'll slowly start to hurt less, day after day.  What you're feeling right now I think is a healthy and normal reaction. I know it doesn't feel like it, but you're going to be ok. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But someday.\n\nGive yourself time to heal. You don't have to feel normal until you're ready, so don't try to rush back to how things were. It's going to take time. I suggest talking. Surround yourself with family and friends. Talk out how you feel with people you love and trust and who love and trust you back. If you aren't ready or up to do that, writing letters helps me sometimes.\n\nWhen you start feeling a little better (not before, don't rush it!) I'd say start picking up things that you like first. Do you like art? Paint yourself a little something thats for your eyes only. Nobody else ever has to see it if you don't want. Music, same thing. The idea is, when you're ready, give yourself a way to express how you feel.\n\nIt's going to be ok. You aren't to blame. Take it slow, and one day at a time. Sending all the support and care your way. Hang in there. Oh, and therapy helps! It really does!",
    "Hey, OP. I survived a school shooting 10 years ago. Lost 3 classmates.\n\nI am so sorry to hear you are going through this. It pains my soul to have to hear of another fatal school shooting. \n\nPlease, please, PLEASE do not hesitate to reach out to me via PM if you need to vent or talk. We survivors need to stick together and be there for each other. \n\nI hate to say that I know exactly what you\u2019re going through. Not many people could tell me that at the time. I hard not to feel guilt, and it\u2019s something I still live with today.\n\nI know it\u2019s easier said than done, but try to hang in there. Lean into the support system that is your community and your classmates. I really hope you have that. \n\nYou will get through this. Lots of love to you. \u2764\ufe0f",

I honestly think you should find someone to talk to because what you\u2019re describing absolutely sounds like PTSD and it\u2019s completely normal after something so traumatic.

    "You are likely experiencing what is described as survivors guilt. Questioning why you lived and others didn't. There is no true way to make survivors guilt go away and it is usually a result of trauma.  You should see a therapist for this as you went through something that was extremely traumatic. You probably feel like you have lost control of your life. \n\nThe questions you are asking yourself likely don't have any answers. Why did you live and others didn't? What makes you deserve to live more than the others. Remind yourself when you ask yourself these things that you don't need an answer for them. You may find yourself feeling that you don't deserve to feel bad because you survived but I assure you that it is okay to feel sadness, anger, and whatever else yo may feel. The more you internalise this experience the worse it will get so seek help as soon as possible and don't think that you should just move on with your life. You have the right to be affected by this and to get help for this. You don't have to be okay and it's important to realise and accept that.",
    "I\u2019ve been a soldier in the US Army for 8 yrs. There is no right way to handle these types of situations. Police offices and soldiers are trained for years in order to have standards that over take instinct. \nDon\u2019t let this define you! Very few people will ever live through what you experienced which can be painful because no one will understand your struggle. Find help and build a good support system!

Never really been phased by hearing about school shootings until this one. it feels weird for me to feel this way about it even though I\u2019m not from Oxford but the way people joke about it online put me into so much shock. Especially the football player who died while on the way to the hospital, I saw an Instagram story mocking him and that fucked me up. I\u2019ve never really felt emotion seeing stuff online in this context. Just realized I accidentally ranted when this is supposed to be about you, sorry. I can\u2019t even express how sorry I am for everyone. Please go to therapy and process your emotions with a professional who can do that with you. I\u2019m sorry that your life feels like it\u2019ll never be the same. And I\u2019m sorry that I may not have answers and that all I have to say is how much I\u2019m sorry for you, but I\u2019m truly so sorry for you and I hope the shooter gets exactly what he deserves.",

Cry, scream, write. Whatever will get this initial shock out. \n\nPlease (if you have access) speak to a trauma counselor. Talk to your parents. Talk to your friends. Talk to Reddit. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that you had to experience this. I wish you comfort and peace",
    "This is a completely normal response. I can\u2019t imagine going through that, I am so sorry. Feel free to let yourself cope how you need to right now, and when you\u2019re ready I\u2019d highly encourage you to go see a therapist to help you cope with it, or else it may fester into PTSD coping the rest of your life (I\u2019m still learning to unfold mine from trauma that happened 10 years ago when I was 15).",

You're absolutely so strong and I'm extremely sorry for what happened. Please try and take care of yourself.",

Ask your parents to get you in to see a trauma therapist sooner rather than later -- they might be in high demand in your area starting now.

    "Let me tell you my side of story. I am from Bangladesh. This country is pretty peaceful compared to other Muslim countries but there was a disastrous event happened during 2009. Probably that was the most deadliest event after Bangladesh got her independence. You may search \"BDR tragedy/rebels\" on google/facebook though I don't recommend you to do that since you were already terrified. On that coup/war the border guard forces from Bangladesh are suddenly started revolt and started killing armies, polices, civilians that they are supposed to protect indiscriminately. Everything is happening really close from my house. There were millions of gunshots, shooting mortars grenades everywhere that we were too scared to go outsides and escape from that hell hole. Fighter planes, helicopters were flying like crazy maniacs . After those insurgents started to surrender, many tried to escape from their camp and threw many heavy ammunition including light machine guns, pistol, rifels, grenade and so on in front of my houses. Our area looks like a battle royale games since there are weapons everywhere. There was disgusting smell of rotten dead bodies, buildings shattered with bullet holes everywhere. I was too scared to go outside. Everytime I tried to eat, I feel like vomiting. I can't tolerate any type of sounds of explosions because It reminds me of that events. But everything started to become normal after six months or so on. So I suggest you to take your time surround yourself people who fun to hang out. Try to get busy with various activities for example : self improvement stuffs and stay far away from anything that reminds you of that terrible event. I hope everything will be alright. Pardon for my poor English.",
    "Im sorry.. thats horrible and not anything anyone should have to deal with, especially at school.  There are no answers as to why people are so cruel, and I hope the government and society can buck up to prevent this moving forward.

I hope you start feeling a little better over time. Again im so sorry",

It takes a lot of time to get over a tragedy like this, not that you ever really \"get over\" it. I think as a society we're conditioned to feel like we should move on immediately and jump right back into productive life.\n\nAll of the advice everyone is giving here is great and I second everything people have said, but don't be hard on yourself if you feel like everything is a mess right now and you're not able to follow some of that good advice.  People process these kinds of events in different ways, these kinds of tragedies have reverberations that echo throughout society and so many more victims than what the news reports on.",

EVERYTHING is to blame on that kid (and his parents considering everything that\u2019s come to light). \n\nYou might also consider talking to your friends.

It\u2019s not your fault. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re weak, and it doesn\u2019t meant your network failed you, it just means the trauma was too intense. It\u2019s not your fault.

    "I don't really want to step into the middle of a second amendment debate here... but what do you propose as a solution here?\n\nUltimately, having observed how the media and public respond to school shootings - I really think if they stopped obsessing so much over the perpetrators, and let them die or be arrested as no-name losers, a lot less people would be inclined to commit copycat shootings.\n\nRemember the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007?  Within hours, the killer's name (which I won't repeat) started being spread all over - NBC even aired the guy's manifesto after he had killed himself...now young people everywhere got this idea that if they want to be a martyr, all they had to do was find a gun and shoot up their school and they'll get their 15 minutes of fame\n\nIf not guns, there will always be something.  Back in my day, people made bomb threats.  They had cops lining the building.  These kids will find a way to maim or kill as many people possible, even if somehow guns became illegal.\n\nIMO, the best way to go about this is two-fold...\n\n1: If you see anything (even if it appears to be satire or a joke) posted by another that references violence, hurting or killing other people, REPORT IT TO AUTHORITIES.  In the case of this Michigan shooter, the kid posted photos of him holding the gun, made statements saying \"see you tomorrow, Oxford\", his MOM even posted about her helping him shoot at targets, the *school* knew about this and called his parents over drawings he made of bloody classmates... anyone with a brain would know this kid was up to no good, but yet police were never called, not even by the school.  WTF?\n\n2: If in the event a shooting DOES happen anyway, news media needs to not disclose the identity of the perpetrator, not even photos, nothing.  let that POS rot in jail until the trial.  Focus on the victims, talk about their lives... news got it right this time around until later that day when the killer's name started coming over the airwaves along with photos of him in a prison jumpsuit.\n\nIs it perfect? No, but it should at least disincentivize people from trying to do similar.  Especially if #1 is followed regularly, anyone making vague posts about shooting their school would get charged with a crime and probably think twice about doing it.",

Well, we take way longer to \u201cforget\u201d and in most cases it lives with us forever. Yet they say we are the problem.",
    "I used to. I spent years in misery because of it, especially at night when I tried to sleep - it was always worst when I was tired. It became a self-sustaining whirlpool that became self hatred over the years - I have pretty bad depression, SAD and a less severe autistic spectrum disorder, all of which were diagnosed a long time after all this. I'd say there was an easy solution but it was rough for me:\n\nI hit rock bottom several times. Each time I just gave up to the misery, and after each time I had to rebuild myself, trying to make a better more sustainable person out of the ashes. Finally after a really bad one I had enough with the constant guilt, and I don't know why but I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't waste any more energy on self loathing.\n\nFirst off I made myself look at an unwelcome memory when it came up, but from a purely analytical point of view, and figure out a lesson from it - what I could say the next time that situation happened, or what I learned to avoid, that kind of thing. I had to keep doing this over and over again, but eventually the intrusive thoughts started to become less and less important.\n\nSecondly, I learned to laugh at myself when I fucked up, and own it. If I fell on my arse in front of people I would try to laugh and take a bow. I learned how to use offensive humour to break social tension. I learned to stop taking myself too seriously. This also took years of practice, as well as some friends who stuck with this newest version of me. I now automatically force myself to take a hold of the uncertainty and rip it up.\n\nAfter all this, I am more comfortable with myself now than I ever used to be. I'm not finished - and I never will be. Life isn't reaching some standard, it's being able to change, and look at yourself critically and not negatively and deciding to make a positive change. Over, and over, and over again. And that's fine I now realise. Hope my experience might help in some small way, and wishing you and all the others feeling like this an easier road than I had.",
    "Absolutely, I always try to remind myself that I'm cringing about my actions because I've grown and matured as a person. You feeling guilt is a way of your brain telling you that you shouldn't do that ever again because it conflicts with the person you are now. As crappy as it feels thinking about it try to pay yourself back by never doing it again. The past is out of our control but everything else from this moment forward is completely up to you.",

Its not a sign of mental issues, unless the memories do more than make you feel like shit temporarily. \nWe all have done things we regret, sometimes we regret instantly, sometimes it takes years of maturing to realise how wrong we were, sometimes it had bad consequences, sometimes it did nothing except being humiliating. Unfortunately, I dont have any tricks for it to stop happening. All I can tell you is to forgive yourself. If you feel like it, you can even appologize to your mom. The memory and guilt will still be there, but at least you would have tried to make amends. \n\nMemories will stick with us for a long time. You can't erase the past. It's like... It's like your exes. As much as you may hate them,now, as much as you are happy now with yourself, or with someone else, you still have memories (good or bad) of being with your ex. And sometimes you can be horrified because you just dreamed of an ex. It doesn't necessarily mean you subconsciously want to go back with them, it doesn't mean you don't like your current partner, it just mean that your ex, with whom you shared a part of your life, is in your memories, and will stay there for a long while. \n\nIts the same with bad memories. They will always be there. Why they come back out of know here I can't tell. But there here to stay. My bad memories still hurt, but I made amends where it was needed.",

    "I am a hypnotherapist and I deal with these common issues.\n\nHere's what has helped me and what I've learned;\n\n1. When the feelings arise with the thoughts, take a very deep breath, filling your lungs as much as you can.\n\n2. Release the breath.\n\n3. Disconnect with the thoughts and feel the emotions. Disconnect with the thoughts by taking another smaller deep breath.\n\n4. Feel the emotions and breathe through it. You can even imagine dark energy leaving your body and refill the body with light. Usually you'll feel like a tangible heart pain, accompanied by anxiety. It is important not to get to distracted by the thoughts at this point because it will lock the emotion in your body if you can't break free from the thoughts. It's ok to think about the trauma that caused the pain. This is the energy arising to the surface. It is natural to think about the source trauma and thoughts causing your emotional pain. Remember, do your best not to get locked in the thought because the pattern of; think the thought, feel the pain, think the thought, feel the pain will repeat.\n\n5. Continue deeply breathing through the pain. More pain will arise but you MUST continue breathing through it. If it gets too much take a break. But the longer you avoid facing and releasing the trauma, the longer your problems will last. \n\n6. Depending how much guilt and shame you have stored in your body this will take time. \n\n7. When you're done, and you no longer feel the emotional pain rising up, sit in this moment as long as you can. Tell yourself \"I am healing and progressing. I love myself. I am growing. I am evolving.\" In this relaxed state, the subconscious mind becomes very open, and these affirmations install \"programs\" into your brain to help you deal with future emotions.\n\nSide notes; \nWe are never perfect or complete.\n\nWe are energy beings. Thus, using the deep breathing method can release stored traumas by intending we are now choosing to release the pain.\n\nWhen we store traumas we will get manifestations of sickness like cancer, colds, sore throats, etc. We can also get pain like shoulder, back, and knee pain.\n\nIt is easier and safer to use this natural method to release the pain rather then burying it, taking meds and continuing to manifest sickness from the toxic energy. \n\nThis is one form of healing thru trauma. There are other natural ways.\n\n One way is by writing down the thoughts that trigger the pain, and why you feel the way you do when that thought comes across your mind. Next, meditate by taking a deep breath, release, and then take another deep breath. As you release it notice how your lungs and chest feel as you breathe naturally. Keep bringing your attention to the chest. Once you feel deeper relaxed, say something to yourself like \"as I continue breathing, I am fully releasing the trauma and bringing in happiness (feel happiness), peace (feel it), and joy (feel it).\" This method requires more attention and professional help. However, try it by yourself. It can only help.\n\nIt is important to remember that healing is a process, it is painful and if left untreated (self-treatment is extremely valid, dont doubt yourselves) it will get worse, potentially causing constant suicidal thoughts and may ultimately end up with you taking your own life.\n\nLast thing, we are meant to experience deep energy here on Earth. Do not beat yourselves up for experiencing life and its grand adventure.\n\nBless you and your healing. Good luck!",

    "Man, I can totally relate and I can tell you what I think worked for me.\n\nThe reason these thoughts keep popping again in your head is because you've been supressing them for so long. Everytime they come to surface you just push them aside because they make you feel guilty. What you should do instead is let them fully come to the surface and process them properly. Think well about what actually happened, context, causes, consequences, what you could and couldn't control, what you did wrong and if you regret it, if you grew out of it and are a different person right now, ask yourself why do you feel like this and other questions relevant in the matter. \n\nProcessing of emotions is a bit of an abstract matter and it may be different for anyone and hard to put into words, but the idea is to no longer supress them by trying to pretend they never happened because they\u00b4ll always come back and you only solved the problem temporarily.",
    "I've heard promising stuff about Intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy (Istdp), which is an effective form of therapy. This might just be what you're looking for.",
    "I totally relate.",
    "Wow thanks for spending your time to write that out I\u2019ll definitely try it. It feels super wrong to say those things to myself but I\u2019ll try a few times. I\u2019ve never dealt with any emotion or problem unless it\u2019s easy to fix so I\u2019m not sure where to start but I guess there isn\u2019t a bad idea. Thanks again, I hope your having a good night!",
    "Wow thank you for that.",
    "Yeah GOD like your not at all the only one. One thing it has led me towards is changing my habits. Being thankful and a lot more forgiving. Just a better human being overall!",
    "Ty!",
    "I know this sounds lame but I always find a few deep breaths and a walk in the wilderness makes me feel less anxious about these kind of things",
    "Is your mom still with you? Thanks for saying that. Hopefully I can at least be a decent mother to them in other ways.",
    "Thank you!. I hope you find a way through it too because it is definitely horrible to feel attacked by your own mind and memories. One thing I can think of that's slightly weirdly positive about it is that we must really care and have a heart even though it is such an unhealthy experience. Some people do not care about any actions they take even if it is very minor. It's not good to care this much though. So we really have to find a way through it :)",
    "I also understand the physical symptoms you experience too from it.",
    "Thank you, kind human. Remember your words for yourself, too. Being a child and not wanting clothes from a thrift store doesn't make you a bad person, it makes you a normal child that wants to fit in and blend in with your peers. That is especially true when experiencing trauma. Share some of your kindness and empathy with yourself, you deserve it. Don't give up, friend. Don't give up.",
    "Thank you for this, I normally go right to the feeling of shame or guilt, but rarely do I think it through more than that.",
    "Same to you! Be nice to yourself. That's the biggest thing. You don't need to send yourself more bs! :)",

    "Yes she\u2019s still with us. And we\u2019ve never had a lot of money, but I still find my mom is very hard to beat. I know some people that grew up with lots of money, but they\u2019re parents don\u2019t come close to my mom. All that I found that mattered is my mom being there for us when it got rough. I\u2019m sure your kids will feel the same.",

    "Bittersweet but it\u2019s comforting hearing that. Yeah I like that way of looking at it, though it can also be disappointing finding yourself as the only one in a relationship (friends, family, partners, etc) doing that. The physical side sucks and generally doesn\u2019t go away for a while so I\u2019m sorry to hear that cuz I get it",
    "OP you might want to see if this fits for OCD for you. I had the same exact issue forever, turns out I have OCD and ADHD. as soon as I started therapy and got my levels right I literally have stopped doing that almost entirely. I worry about the important stuff. It\u2019s really something to look into I hope this helps your healing.",
    "I started Kundalini Yoga last year and it REALLY helped get rid of the negative intrusive thoughts and anxiety. I seriously recommend. \n\nIf in desperate need of something to take your mind away try this... it\u2019s dumb but it works....\n\nhttps://youtu.be/b6VjTwaWJEU",
    "Thank you. Please say these things to her, how you felt about these little things you said as a child and how you see things now. It will be so good for both of you. There are a lot of things I wish I could have said to my mother but I only realised them after she died. I\u2019ve lost that chance, don\u2019t lose yours.",
    "Might be worth a shot. My dad had lots of issues including ocd and adhd, I have been told I have add and my sister has adhd (diagnosed). I always stop myself from asking though because I don\u2019t want to act like I have something I don\u2019t. If that makes sense",
    "THIS! I had no idea for the longest time that obsessive thinking was actually a form of OCD until I was talking to my therapist about these sudden and deep feelings of guilt and how it would wash over me and consume me for the rest of the day. After finding that out, a lot of other symptoms also made sense, some that I didn't even know were considdered symptoms. It has been a huge relief to be diagnosed and getting on the right meds. I'm not completely better yet, but am so much happier now.",
    "I legit could go through a very long extensive story about my experience because, I totally get it.\n\n\nTo sum it, OCD and Depression can sometimes appear through ADHD especially if it\u2019s not medicated and severe, like my case. I almost always felt I had some ocd tendencies but Prozac wasn\u2019t exactly hitting all of the things I knew were fixable. \n\nAnyway, my psychiatrist let me do a test for ADHD, it\u2019s like a really old computer game with a camera... but it will let you know if you have it or not. You have to have 2 out of the 3 to be diagnosed officially. You can\u2019t fake those results, much like you can convince yourself of something mentally and then doubt if it was real later. That gave me a lot of insight. \n\nI feel a lot better now. I still have days, but they don\u2019t bother me anymore as much.",
    "100% I\u2019m so happy for you! Once I realized some of my thoughts and dwellings were considered \u201cintrusive thoughts\u201d and not myself, it made a big difference.",
    "That\u2019s great! Glad to hear that it\u2019s calmed down for the most part. Yeah I should be fine it\u2019s stopped a lot compared to what it used to be.",
    "Just keep an eye on it, it\u2019s a tricky fickle little bitch. I wish you well! Reach out any time, I don\u2019t have a network of people that experience mental health.",
    "Thanks I appreciate it. Sorry for snooping but I got curious. Your caramel coloured dog reminds me of my dog I had when I was younger I love it. Also, that whirlpool/jellyfish drawing is awesome!",
    "These truly are art. Please let me know if you do decide to sell any of them. Or if there is a way I could donate money or send supplies to keep you stocked. Canvas and paints aren't cheap! \n\nYou may also consider selling prints or even turning the series into a book showing your artistic evolution through your journey to be clean. \n\nAnd bravo for 3 weeks clean! I have struggled with addiction in the past myself and know how hard it can be. Seeing someone turn their struggle into art is truly inspiring. ",

    "Looks awesome! Like a quilt for your wall lol",
    "Those look great! Be on the lookout for manic symptoms though. My friend with bipolar loves to paint all day and night when manic, and then crashes a few weeks later and stops painting completely. Painting is an excellent coping skill, but I just wanted to share this cautionary tale to make sure it\u2019s not something more.",

    "Beautiful! ",
    "That is gorgeous!! Well done!",
    "They are beautiful stay strong",
    "That's insanely beautiful!  I love all the pictures hung on the wall. \u2764 Congrats on your milestone! ",
    "Amazing work. Remember, ANY rationalization that it's ok to use is addiction talking. The only path is never again. And if you're like most of us, no other shit either. Not sure what your quitting, but booze lowers your inhibitions, but inhibitions are what keeps you clean. And just say goodbye to any friends even slightly involved in that old life. They may be good people, but they can't be your friends anymore. Connect with people you knew before, people who love you and want the best for you first. Stay strong. Its never over, but it does get easier. ",
    "So proud of you!!! I also found that in an effort to nit blow money on drugs I\u2019d take whatever paychecks I didn\u2019t use for bills and Immediately buy gift cards to Michael\u2019s or AC Moore craft stores that way I could purchase art supplies as a coping skill instead of using the cash for drugs. That way I could use it for my creative outlet spending (canvas and art supplies get hella expensive too) and not on opiates or benzos.) I paint too to help cope with major depressive disorder, PTSD, and addiction. I will definitely look you up on Instagram. Art is a fabulous coping skill and has definitely gotten me through some really difficult times in my life. I am currently in a relapse but you\u2019ve definitely inspired me... might just go downstairs and pick up my inks and brush! Again, congrats- very proud and happy for you and your art is beautiful by the way! \ud83c\udfa8 ",
    "Amazing, beautiful pictures! I get food cravings. Wish I could paint like you.",
    "That is actually a pretty good idea!",

    "It's so great to be able to follow your journey and amazing to see you turning something so difficult into such beautiful and creative pieces. Think everyone here is so so proud of you",

    "I also have bipolar and I'm well aware that I'm manic. But I'm also on a medication change over , recovering from self harm and trying to kick a nasty drug habit (opioid and pot addiction). So my body's taking on a lot. I'm just riding it out. I'm scared by the end of it that I won't be able to paint but what I created is pretty sick so I'm happy wherever I end up.",

    "Thanks I wished the same also but I guess that's the shitty thing about inner battles like this.

    "who or what says that you can't just break down and cry? even just for a few hours? everyone needs to do that sometimes",
    "I honestly can\u2019t cry much. I always got told to stop and that \u201cmen don\u2019t cry\u201d whenever I was younger. \n\nAnd honestly it\u2019s hard for me to verbally express sad emotions in general",
    "I'm sorry, that's horrible that you were told that. I'm sure you know this already, but it's okay to cry. I hope you get some time to take a break, and do whatever you want to without anyone judging you. i wish i could do more, but I'm sending a virtual hug <3 the kind of hug that's safe and comforting. you can always rant in my dm's if you'd like and i won't judge you. hang in there",

    "I know exactly what you mean, in bed you can avoid distractions and just think about what\u2019s important, the motivation that you feel likely is what the right thing to do. You dropping it is likely due to distractions of what is effecting you to stop doing what you\u2019re motivated to do. Let\u2019s say for example (this is the one that applied to me and may not be the same for you, I\u2019m going to mention it anyway though) you are addicted to a video game or a social media platform when you want to study. When your in bed, you don\u2019t have to energy to go on social media or play on the game so you just think and you realise what you need to do. What I believe the best thing to do is (it may not be the best, I\u2019m not a phycologist) is to literally do at least something close to what you want to achieve that night that will effect you the next day or take away the distraction. For me, that was deleting social media off my phone as well as all the games I had. The next day I started getting upset and stayed in my room (probably withdrawal symptoms) but because I already deleted my games, I didn\u2019t need to worry about doing anything extreme and the day after I was able to study again. This obviously isn\u2019t the same as something like alcoholism but I feel it could apply to anything. Getting rid of what\u2019s holding you back (at least temporarily) will help push you towards what you want to achieve. The next 3 am you get I think you should do this (although it may not be the same for certain situations, respond if there\u2019s a problem). You can guarantee you will be happier in the long run",
    "I'm the same. I go to bed with a huge plan for the next day. I wake up and I can't even remember what I was meant to to do. I don't even remember that I forgot about the stuff, and even if I do remember, it's like I don't have motivation. \n\nMaybe I have a broken internal clock, or maybe I need to eat bigger breakfasts.",
    "Yes.\n\nIt used to be that clarity only came at night after I relaxed from the day, and I'd get excited about things to get started on in the morning.\n\nMorning comes, all motivation gone.\n\nFinally got on Ritalin at 50 years old.  I actually follow through now on the projects I think about instead of only focusing on what I have to get done.  It seems to counter act my morning depression and anxiety, removing the mental blocks and scattered thinking that kept me from acting on previous plans.",
    "Honestly very relatable. I've been acknowledging my issues lately and this is one of the many that causes me distress. I don't understand what's wrong with me and also what I need to do get out of this evident toxic cycle. I also don't know whether it's something I can overcome myself or need someone to help me. It's frustrating and I feel like I'm going crazy after discovering there are so many things wrong with me.",
    "100% yes, to the point where I'll actually start writing articles in my head, largely against my will when I'm trying to sleep (I'm a writer). The content literally flows to me in these fully formed downloads--and it's normally pretty good stuff!-- but it's the middle of the night and I'm don't want to start writing and mess up my sleep schedule. I can carry some of it forward into the next day normally, but damn I wish I could have that sort of focus and idea generation in the daytime. Super weird.\n\nI asked my therapist about this and she said the nighttime productivity/creativity might occur because there's nothing to distract me then, so I can think more clearly. I also struggle with a lot of anxiety during the day, and have found that my anxiety levels are normally lowest at night (when I've burned through my daily cortisol?)--so maybe I just have less stress standing in the way at 3AM. Who knows.",
    "yup. i went to bed at 1:25 thinking that i will feel happy that the days over and tommorow will start anew and then i sleep in till 11:00 am and feel like shit the rest of the day.",
    "Absolute! I was in this place 5 years back when I had my son. So much creativity running through my mind, so many thoughts and motivations for the future. But never really any plan or action to my thoughts. It wasn't until I found out the real thing that was holding me back from taking action. Here are 4 strategies you can use to try to help you navigate these thoughts and start to put a plan together so you can start taking action.\n\nReally break these thoughts down into tangible goals. Think about one of the thoughts and try to write it out as an action. Thinking of all the layers and steps involved in your idea. This first part is very visual, try to visualize this to the point of where you can see you doing the action, smell the environment etc...\n\nOnce you have the goal or idea written down in  a sentence, ask yourself some questions: in a perfect world how will I complete this task, what is holding me back from doing this, where should I start with this, how would completing this make me feel, why do I want to complete this. \n\nLastly think about your plan of action, how does it make you feel. Think about the initiating step of getting started, are you scared, are you nervous are you anxious? Now sit with those feelings for a bit. Taking the first step is always the scariest, starting something new brings anxiety, fear, excitement, but remember the first step is the hardest. Challenge yourself by stepping out of your comfort zone.\n\nAnd remember give yourself grace. Try not to be so hard on yourself, we all make mistakes, mistakes do not define us, the defining moment is what we do with those mistakes.",
    "Yes! My motivation works a lot like the main character's memory does in the film Memento. I start from scratch every morning looking at post it's or white boards with tasks and ideas on them that I couldn't care less about doing, but which felt essential when I jotted them down the day before.",
    "I often do this. I consider myself a night owl and am my most awake, motivated, and inspired at night. Unfortunately this is when I am trying to fall asleep so it can keep me up and fuck with my sleep schedule. But I have come up with my best ideas and have the most motivation at night. It can be frustrating cause I'll be laying in bed thinking about how I could clean the house right now, but I can't just spend all night cleaning when my husband and I both gotta work in the morning. I often struggle with motivation so it kills me knowing I'm wasting it cause I gotta sleep.",
    "Take it at 3\n\nYou aren\u2019t working your circadian rhythm. \n\nGet a night shift job or reset so you can work from home at 3 AM and then go to your 9 AM job. Go to bed early. Switch your day a round. Instead if kicking back after work as your \u2018free\u2019 time- use the 3 AM to 9 AM instead.",

    "Similar. Usually I experience this a few hours before the end of my work day and start thinking of all the things I'll do when I get home, to the point that I'm so excited and can't wait to get home. By the time I get home, the thought of doing those exact same things makes me feel, urrrgh!",

    "baaahahahahahahahaha yes.\n\ni look forward going to sleep so i can keep working on my projects and personal goals but i wake up and end up wasting the day away. have been trying to do at least two things of things i plan the night before, but still.",
    "Yes it\u2019s annoying.",
    "All the time. I'm only really productive in reading, homework, whatever I need to get done in front of a computer at night. Daytime I have to move move move. Chores etc.\n\nI don't know why I'm like that. It makes the usual 9-5 a struggle.",

Often times we can be motivated at some times than other times. I know that often times what I try to do is just find a way/a reason to be motivated. I don't know what you are going through, but try to set a little schedule of things that you will be doing/that needs to be done. And than set one for things you want to be done. See if you can figure out the NEEDS list, and than if you have motivation, figure out the WANTS. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuckMakesThings",
    "I know this feeling. For many years now I\u2019ve procrastinated on everything until late at night and stayed up until 4am. I found that I preferred working on that time because it was quiet and peaceful then. There was no pressure. No one was watching me, no one was even awake. I could be or do anything I wanted at that time. However, I still needed to wake up on time. Go to work or school on time. Be awake and give all my attention to other people on time. The consistent lack of sleep and lack of motivation made this difficult. I\u2019d usually go through my day in zombie mode thinking about how I\u2019d rather be home sleeping or watching tv, then I\u2019d get home and crash. I\u2019d wake up at around 8pm, procrastinate a lot, then start doing things to unwind or work at 10pm until 4am. Then repeat. It quickly and very easily becomes a vicious cycle.\n\nI\u2019m told it\u2019s a very common symptom of depression to procrastinate on everything like this. I did manage to fix this habit, but only after getting on medication that fixed my motivation problem and worked on myself. Now I wake up at 6am to have my quiet time, go for a run and watch the sunrise and get an early start on work.  I put myself on a schedule that is reinforced by alarms from my iPhone to start and stop working at a certain time, go to bed at 10pm, and wake up at 6am. I feel a lot better, and a lot more focused.",
    "I've heard that scientific studies show that this burst of energy is actually meant to heal/reinvigorate our bodies, which is why it happens at 11pm-3am, so if you're asleep before those times you should wake up feeling better.",
    "I do feel the same and its kind of sickening because i do feel like i'm already behind and everytime that i tell myself \"i'm gonna be doing this and that\" then i end up not doing at all, its actually pretty frustrating. \n\nWhat i do, i spend time alone in bed. This is hard i tell you but i kind of identify what seems to be my problem. What's making me lose my motivation, what's making me lose the drive to achieve what I had set my mind to, and etc. If i figured i just need more time to compose myself, i'll do it LITTLE BY LITTLE. Until i feel encouraged or motivated to do what i had set my mind to do. \n\nNot having motivation is normal, with everything thats going on around us, its really driving us crazy.",
    "Meditate in the morning",
    "I've had that and couldn't really get shit working in the mornings ever... my advice? Change your sleep schedule. Third shift is so kind to me and I get a lot of things done/ have more energy to do them. It's so weird man I can get 8 hours of sleep and wake up at 9am and not wanna do a damn thing but get the exact amount of sleep and wake up at 9pm and it's like alright game time let's get this shit done! I genuinely believe some humans are nocturnal...",
    "Every. single. night.  That's why I changed my entire schedule and work graveyard, etc.",
    "Yes! Aw I hate that. :( I start to feel creative and want to make things but it\u2019s too late at night.",
    "IDK, it seems like you don\u2019t know enough, so your desire to improve isn\u2019t backed by the knowledge to do it. The pandemic has made this kind of situation difficult because if you get disappointed you\u2019re kind of stuck with it for a lot longer than what is healthy.\n\nThe only way to push through is to become the best version of yourself that\u2019s easily maintained, so like working out, making love, budgeting, and eating right is the bare minimum IMO to get to the next level.",
    "My theory has always been that your serotonin levels are higher at night. You wake up in the morning feeling crap, and slowly start feeling better and better. I do however also find that having a healthy sleep pattern helps with this. Oh and I can't have ANY caffeine at all, no tea, no coffee, no chocolate nothing, it all has caffeine in and I don't sleep well as a result.",
    "Absolutely! Not sure what your work schedule's like, but I'm pretty flexible. And definitely a night owl. I do my BEST WORK between the hours of 4-7pm and 10pm-2am. I'll answer some emails during the day, but the night is where the work gets done! Covid has been liberating in a way because I don't have to show up in person. No one cares! It's great because I can be productive when I know I can. I'm totally ok no waking up until noon, then do errands and what not, and then I can rest easy knowing I got some awesome work done! --the only thing gnawing at me is knowing I'm not ordinary.

    "Me, here, now",
    "This is kind of like dopamine detoxing. Dopamine is your drive and motivation system. When you are down and depressed your dopamine production is extremely low meaning you lack drive to do even the most basic things even when important. The problem with addictions, such as video games, is it produces lots of dopamine and \"feels\" good. You become sensitised to this level dopamine. This coupled with the low amount of dopamine produced the rest of the time means you crave and seek out levels of dopamine that you are still sensitive too, in other word back to video games. This is very similar to how the body builds up resistances to caffeine as well. You can reset your dopamine sensitivity by taking a few days off activities you know to be producing large amounts of it. Like when cutting caffeine out of your diet, you will feel like shit while doing this, so expect this and be compassionate to yourself while doing it. Afterwards you should find yourself with more drive and motivation to tackle some more mundane tasks and activities.\n\nOf course, it's a lot easier said than done, and if you suffer from depression you just simply may not be producing enough dopamine to feel like doing anything anyway. I can only suggest looking into mindfulness, meditation and self-compassion. It sounds like hippy bs but, like above, serves a very (bio-)mechanical purpose in the brain.",
    "Deleting games?? This mans is crazy y'all.",
    "Except, it's usually when I'm looking through social media that I get a burst of motivation. When I'm scrolling through Reddit(heh) or looking at YouTube videos late at night, I get this feeling that I have to fix my horrible, broken life. But even when I don't use social media in the morning, I still lose that motivation. \n\nAlso, getting rid of distractions is *horrible* for me. I can literally never stop thinking, so at least when my mind is captivated by something, I can channel my thoughts into something that doesn't give me a massive headache. This is probably just avoiding the real problem, but it works, and I haven't found an alternative.",

    "There is some science behind this. Going back to hunter-gatherer days, it's hypothesized that some people were pre-disposed with an altered circadian rhythm so at least some members of the tribe could be awake during all hours so there was always protection :) ...We aren't evolved to be a strict 9-5 society!",

    "I deleted a video game I believed that was taking up too much of my time and decided to enjoy the summer. One of my best summers ever!",
    "I'm pretty sure I was at the extreme end of this. Basically it was one of the many signs, so I'm in no way suggesting anyone else who has late night motivation has BPD or NPD.   \n\n\nBut anyways, ya it was just one of the many signs. BPD and anything related to sleep is a big indicator. So while my \"late night motivation\" certainly wasn't being done while I was physically sleeping, it was in that winding down period. When your brain just starts getting ready to crash for the night. I would have so much enthusiasm for tomorrow, for my life, for my goals, what I was going to do, what I was going to change, ect.   \n\n\nOf course like so many, when I woke up it was an afterthought.   \n\n\nBut because it was being done during that period of 'wind down' brain/sleep function, coupled with the intensity of the \"motivation\" they were grandiose. They weren't just, \"I'm going to wake up and shower\" or \"I'm going to wake up and exercise\" they were more I'm going to change my life, I'm going to be the best version of myself, I'm going to be super successful, I'm going to be important.    \n\n\nVery much on the extreme end of motivation. Unrealistic really. I'm going to wake up and start working out and I'm going to be as big as Brock Lesnar one day. No, no your not. He's a genetic freak who's spent 25-30 years working out to get there.   \n\n\n  \nSo again, it was because it was being done during the early sleep cycle (in terms of brain activity) because of the context, because of all the other signs (that had nothing to do with sleepcycle/motivation) it was felt that BPD and NPD were pretty strong contenders for conditions.",
    "Forgot to add,   \n\n\nOf course sitting here now of clear mind I know how silly it is to think I could ever become Brock 2.0. But at that time, in that moment, its perfectly reasonable. It feels like something I could easily, naturally do. Like there's nothing stopping me. I'm just going to wake up and do it.   \n\n\nBut you couldn't tell me at that time, in that moment, that what I was thinking/saying was the stupidest shit, like impossible shit. It legit feels like something I could do, will do and thats that.   \n\n\nThen I wake up.",
    "Can confirm this describes me to a T, i have bpd and quite sure narc tendencies (to be confirmed)",
    "If you don't mind my asking, was there anything else that informed those diagnoses, or was that considered the defining thing? Or like the final definitive indicator, or whatever. \n\nThe BPD I can see no problem, just because it's tied so closely to trauma which in turn tends to lead to ADHD, which a ton of BPD people struggle with. I guess the Narc thing took me by surprise, idk. \n\nAnyway, if you don't feel like talking about it nbd. Just caught my attention is all.",
    "Dont have an issue talking about it at all. \n\nIt was one of the many signs. Many many signs. I've learned over the years how to be very introspective. Now that may seem very anti-narcissistic behaviour but it actually comes from a very deep seeded Narcissistic place. \n\nI want to talk about myself, my problems, my issues, my everything. Like I am now. Now, let me be clear, you're not enabling me right now. I genuinely like to help people better understand themselves, and I guess me too. I do get a reward from helping people. \n\nSo anyways, because i've been able to really share, speak and be honest about my thoughts, my feelings, my struggles, my everything, I've been able to dump so much information and so many different signs of Narc and BPD. \n\nIt was a pretty cut and dry diagnosis once I was able to sit down with someone and do their stupid testing and dump my thoughts into them. \n\nSo ya, it was just one of the many things. \n\nAnother big one was my inability to have empathy for someone. I've had long term partners, people i've genuinely cared for, I'm hesitant to say 'loved' anymore, but 100% I cared for them. I've sat across from them, them crying in emotional or physical pain, all I had to do was reach out for them and I would make it all better, and have the inability to do so. I would blankly stare at them, right through their eyes, thinking the whole time \"Why dont they stop\" \"Why dont I feel anything\" Knowing the entire time what I was doing was wrong, but not able to do anything about it. Them screaming at me \"Just reach out for me, hold me\" and me just frozen, unable to do so. \n\nLooking back through my life this was the case with everyone i've cared for. \n\nBut what made it all change, was my daughter. I'm a father to three girls. 18/16 and 6. \n\nI love my kids. I really do. I feel for them things I've never felt for anyone. One day, not too long ago, I had my youngest daughter with me. She was crying at one edge of the couch, and I was at the other. I wasn't speaking to her, I wasn't comforting her, I wasn't reaching out to her. \n\nIt wasn't until she looked up at me, with tears in her eyes and reached her arms out, did I reach out for her. The MOMENT I reached out for her, she jumped into my lap, wrapped herself up in my arms and cried. I held her, and cried. I realized then in that moment that something was seriously wrong with me and I just hurt my baby girl. Sitting here now, I'm tearing up thinking about that moment. Just typing it out now, I can relive and feel the hurt in her and the disappointment I had in myself. \n\nI failed her. And I never want to fail anyone like that ever again. The pain I must have caused my exes. Nobody deserves that. \n\n\nWith in days I had spoken to a Dr, had a referral to mental health, and I had reached out to my exes, apologizing for my behaviour. Taking ownership of what must have been a terrible terrible experience. \n\nI cant say I'll never do it again. But I can say that now I know why I did it, why I do it, why I've done it so many times in the past. From the physical pain I've caused so many people growing up, to the emotional pain I've ignored in so many people who've trusted me enough to give themselves emotionally to me. \n\nI fucked up. \n\n\nSo anyways, I may not have 10/10 down the checklist of Narc symptoms, but those I do have, are clearly a symptom of something greater at play in my head. \n\nSo now comes the long journey of recovery, therapy, and making amends.",

I know it sounds simplistic but sometimes when we are grieving we forget about the little things because were lost in the big picture. If you ever need someone to talk to feel free to DM me, anytime, day or night.

Therapy is expensive, I often go on YouTube and find grief related material or motivational speakers such as Les Brown-invest in yourself.

Nothing you could have said or done, nothing you could have changed. When people make that decision, it is theirs entirely.

Others don't find stable work for a long time because they're working on their mental health. Some people are renting forever because they chose to have kids early and struggled to find a career that enables them to buy.\n\nWe're all working on different things in our lives.

It sucks and I really hate myself for putting this off again. I thought I had enough to crank out the paper in a few days well those few days turned into 2 and then one and then I realized how fucked I am. Every time I think about it or even up to 2 weeks ago when I would try to start writing something I would have a panic attack and my only relief was to stop and distract myself.\n\nI\u2019m miserable and have no real excuse for this behavior.

They talk as adults, like business people would, they travel the world alone \n(to be fair, I did manage to travel to London alone because I REALLY wanted to see a musical before it ended. But I had maybe three meals in two days because I didnt wanna sit alone in restaurants and it was way less fun because you just dont have anyone to talk to or be like 'LOOK AT THAT' and yeah), \nthey start up businesses and know how to dress well, do makeup, they eat healthy, don't freak out when there's a dog or cat or just a general nice human being...

    "I completely, COMPLETELY relate to what you're feeling. In my 20's, I was successful in my corporate career, I was a high performer, etc etc. But inside, nobody knew how lonely and ashamed I was. I was very overweight, had no self-confidence, so dating went nowhere. Meanwhile my friends were all getting married. It was brutal, honestly. I was depressed and nobody knew it.\n\nThen at one point, I decided it had to change. I switched to a plant based diet and lost 100 pounds. Along the way I discovered I needed to help others do the same, so I quit my career on wall street and went back to medical school. In doing so, I discovered the person I was meant to be. I discovered who I truly was beneath the shame. And by living into that vision of myself, I effortlessly attracted the love of my life.\n\nWe got married at 35 years old. Behind my friends? Sure. But now I also have friends my age who got married in their early 20's, they and their spouses grew into different people, and now they're divorced or on the verge of it.\n\nWhat I learned is that feeling behind is entirely perspective. I found the woman of my dreams and married her. I have more energy and purpose and health now at 36 than I did at 21. And I get to help other ambitious individuals end self-criticism and silence the negative voice in their head by teaching principles of everyday mental health.\n\nLooking back, I wouldn't have it any other way. Hang in there friend. Design your future self and live into that vision today.\n\n\\- Dr. K",

I don't need to be the most successful person in the room.

Do you have anything you really care about that you want to work toward?",
    "Don't be discouraged by what you see on social media, and don't focus on what other people have accomplished. Do a bit of introspection. First set a goal. You have a couple of options here. If you're feeling overwhelmed, set a series of small goals that will get you pointed in the right direction.\n\nOnce you have a big goal in mind, ask yourself what it will do for you. Depending on what your goal is, how will achieving that goal help you professionally/emotionally/physically/intellectually/personally?\n\nOnce you have that outlined, figure out what you are in relation to that goal, and what options you have to achieve it?\n\nIf it's a goal you've had in the past, l what obstacle did you encounter that prevented you, and what foreseeable obstacles do you see?\n\nOnce you map all of that out, determine your first steps and make a commitment, and keep in mind those reasons you came up with regarding why you're doing this goal in the first place.\n\nLastly, find someone who will support you with your goal.

You may think they are perfect and normal but they are human like you and feel similarly to you in many more ways than you think. \n\nSure maybe they have more things to brag about but that doesn't mean they are \"ahead\" as you put it. They're just doing different things than you at different times of their lives. In reality they also feel insecure about themselves in many ways just like you. You can still feel happy with yourself even if it seems like you're doing nothing with your life. \n\nLife never really gets better or worse, only your outlook on it does, and while being in a better spot may affect your outlook on life, you can have a positive outlook on life at any point.

Everyone moves at their own pace.   I thought it took me longer to learn than peers, and it felt so terribly frustrating and hopeless at times.  I was constantly filled with fear, but after driving VERY cautiously for a couple years ( I can say it took a long while to get comfortable), I  started to feel more comfortable. There are some situations that may warrant anxiety sometimes, but for the most part it won't always be that way.

Don\u2019t feel too bad, I also frequently get overwhelmed and try distracting myself except I do it with drugs to the point where I forget what date it is. I don\u2019t have any unique advice for you but what brings me some peace is knowing that our lives have played out the only way they could have. Not because of destiny or something, but because of the mindsets we were in at the time. So far I haven\u2019t found any use for regret. And hey you finished 99% of college!

    "I spent five years in night grad school from 26-31 while working full time. It was no fun but i wanted a better job. i lived paycheck to paycheck during that time and got student loan debt but i met my educational goals. once i got out of school i put all my energy into my financial goals of paying down my credit card debt and saving for a house and living in the cheapest apartment i could find and drove an old car my brother gave me for free. the first couple of years of my job in my 30s gave me a small pay boost w my advanced degree but bc i was entry level it wasnt much. but i kept up with all that and for a long time it was a whole lot of denying myself a lot of fun and things i wanted. Hated the apartment in part of town that wasnt ideal. Never shopped. went a decade without going on vacation. i met my husband and he had similar financial challenges so we started to meet them together with excel spreadsheets and constant accountabiloty and monitoring. \n\nfor years it felt like it would never. end. we got married cheaply in 2014 when i was 32. continued with our goals. we saved and bought a nice house in 2016. had two kids and continued to drive beatup cars. after a couple payraises and gaining experience i got a big bump in pay finally in 2019 at 37. my husband lost his job in 2019 so we need to re-catch up with savings but overall weve got good jobs low six figures ancouple kids and a nice house. it took a complete and total focus on advancing our jobs while being frugal. \n\nmy parents were not well off at all so i feel \u201crich\u201d now by comparison. when i was 18 i had no idea how much work it would be but i did spend my adult life 18-mis 30s working hard toward being better off eith seemingly zero reward. but eventually the goals all came to fruition bc we had solid plans and stayed focused. it didnt come easy and it was so much patience. but totally worth it.",

So the songs literally felt like they were mentioning me.\n\n  The first verse goes like:   \n\n\n> \"Hey, Nate, how's life?\"  \nI don't know, it's alright  \nI've been dealin' with some things like every human being  \nAnd really didn't sleep much last night (last night)  \n\"I'm sorry\", that's fine  \nI just think I need a little me time  \nI just think I need a little free time  \nLittle break from the shows and the bus rides (bus rides), yeah  \nLast year I had a breakdown  \nThoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud  \nHad to see a therapist, then I found out  \nSomethin' funny's goin' on up in my house \n\nAfter hearing this song and instantly loving it, i decided for the first time at 40 years old to go see a therapist and it really saved me.

    "Not the person you were originally talking to but that sounds really tough. Just wanted to say hang in there, you're so close. You sound like a person with a lot of strength even if you don't feel it. I had a pretty sheltered upbringing and while I'm lucky and incredibly grateful for that, it left me unprepared for the shit that life brings. When you start your job and have had some time to get established your life experience and ability to survive tough times will shine through.",
    "Nah man i understand no need to be sorry to vent. i know more or less what you feel and that's why i have full faith you got this. Your still alive ya? you're resourceful. You're strong. I get it's really hard but don't look at the 4 month goal look at today. What can you do today to up your chances of a better life? That wait time will fly by if all that matter is /now/  Just convince yourself to take each step each day. To avoid any temptation because oh boy are there any number. What, are you going to let life defeat you? are you going to lay down and lose? Nah we are far too stubborn to do that. You'll reach that four months (hopefully less) and walk into a better life looking back at this time not with anger but with gratitude that you made it and learned.\n\nI'm joyous you already have a job and a way out of that life! i spent a year with no hope and would have done anything for that opportunity so hell yes you got this man.

    "I have a friend I cancel on a lot, and he still asks me to meet up and respects whenever I cancel and sometimes just makes me go out, even for a few minutes. For a long time I haven't appreciated that enough, but you're right: such people are like gold.",
    "That is so true. I have been doing lots of hermit time lately and I've ghosted some of my best friends - partly because of feeling overwhelmed, partly because the days kept passing without me realizing.\n\nIt was such a relief to hear from them when I went back up for air. It felt like getting new friends all over again. It makes me slowly want to disappear less and trust that they can handle me, even in my worst.",
    "Absolutely, I think it really helps with getting out of a cycle. When you don't know how they'll react it's extremely anxiety inducing. I sometimes get to a point where I'm counting how many days it's been since I last spoke to them and the more there are the more anxious I get. Luckily all but one of my friends have been great about it and don't pressure me. If they start to get worried, they text me saying I don't have to talk but they just wanna know if I'm oki and if I need anything, which is easy for me to reply to. People like that deserve the stars.",
    "[deleted]",
    "Yes, they really are! What makes me anxious, though, is how many times could I do that to them? They are people, too, and people have limits. But I have limits, too, and I need time to be a hermit. I\u2019m just afraid that one day, when I come back, nobody is there anymore or that they all moved on without me.",
    "I lost a lot of people in my life. I lost a lot of good friends because I dropped contact with them. But I was lucky enough to also have a lot of friends who understand and are always willing to welcome some back as if they were never gone.\n\nI dropped off the face of the earth for some poke 2 years, I lost contact with everyone except my family. But when they found out I was back in town they invited me to hang out with them. So, I went because \"fuck it\" and when I showed up I was greeted by a large Mexican man covered in waxing strips and for the first time in years I felt ok.\n\nThey didn't ask questions. They didn't talk about what happened. It was like I was just picking up where I left off. That's when I realized that my friends were more my home than my house was, and just how horrible my situation was. They honestly saved my life. And over the past 5 years they've proven that it doesn't matter how often I disappear, or for how long, I can always just pick up where I left off with them.",
    "I have a great group of friends who I can proudly call my brothers who no matter what I know will accept me no matter how long I\u2019ve been away. I. I just hope they know how much I appreciate them",
    "Girlfriend left me a month and a half ago. I thought we were happy. She suffers from depression and anxiety. It really started up in February and just continued to get worse. She was honest with me about how she was feeling back then and said her mind messes with how she feels about me, I told her I didn\u2019t care, that I loved her and I would be there for her through it all (we were living together).  She broke up with me around June, saying I deserve better , that she has been unhappy with herself, she doesn\u2019t feel like herself anymore. The very next day she came back crying, saying she was sorry and made a mistake and didn\u2019t want us to be over, and that she will work on herself and that she loved me. The most recent breakup was over the same things. She blindsided me with this breakup, I thought things were so much better but she said the same stuff. She said how she needs to be alone to find her happiness, which I understand. She has been so cold to me since the breakup it\u2019s painful. I just want her to know if she feels like she made a mistake, I am here for her. If she feels like she needs someone, I am here for her. \n\nThanks for listening.",
    "I actually needed to hear this. My best friend goes through intense periods of self-isolation that would last for months straight sometimes. I still get worried. She hasn't responded to my calls and texts for a month now. I'm incredibly worried, but I know that pressuring her won't do her any good because I've been that person before. Sucks sometimes but we got to give people space to breathe and learn on their own when they want to.",
    "I have a lady I met in a Facebook group and we both do 3D art and we messaged back and forth about life, 3D, everything. I'm a young lady myself so I always appreciate advice from older people. Anyway, I have a problem where if I go too long without messaging someone back, I get so stressed out about it that I can't message them ever again. Usually, people just give up on me and that's kind of a relief because I feel so horribly guilty about it that I don't want to face them again. I went about a month without responding to her after talking nearly daily and I felt so guilty whenever I thought about it. One day out of the blue she messages me and asks for help with something with the whole \"if you can't no biggie\" and I messaged her and just thanked her for messaging me. When she messaged me back it like reset my \"conversation timer\" and I felt so happy and relieved and told her about my problem. This isn't anything I do to family or friends but I've done it to a few people I've become acquainted with online. I have no idea why but yeah, I was super happy she didn't give up on me and I was more than happy to help her with her problem.",
    "i try and ghost everyone all the time but my girlfriend (bless her heart) and my close friends won't let me .. i sometimes get mad when people come over but at the end of the day i'm super glad they did and i can do dishes later..  \n\nnow wanting to leave my house is a whole different story.",
    "Rather than gold too",
    "[deleted]",
    "Thank you for this post. One of my best friends has been MIA for almost a yr. Shes sent a couple texts but ignored many more I sent and it hurts especially bad bc I also have depression and one of my biggest triggers is abandonment(and she knows it). I'm trying to be understanding but it can be hard from my own perspective to not feel so dejected. It's helpful to see that other people do this as well",
    "I actually reached out to a friend recently who blocked me for over two years,  found her again and messaged her (realised she\u2019s was going through a lot and it wasnt personal), so I let her know I absolutely missed her and she is  an amazing person, and if she still wanted a friendship with me I\u2019m here and available for her when ever she\u2019s ready. She messaged me back telling me about how she needed to heal from her life, and I get it coz I was going through the same. She is amazing and I\u2019m so happy we reconnected",
    "I realized they were rare like gold during my last episode when someone I THOUGHT was my close friend didnt checkup on me once. Not one time. Over the course of months. I stopped texting and talking, and I didn\u2019t hear from her the entire time. What made me most mad is after I got a bit better and stopped isolating she acted like everything was normal",
    "Had this happen yesterday. Missed 2 hours of work for a doc appointment, and my coworkers were worried about me. It really have me a boost.",
    "I have a couple friends that do that for me, they are happy to have me back and I love them for it. Not all of them have and I have lost quite a few friends along my journeys but the friends I have now are ones that have been through most of everything with me. Always by my side and I love them for it all the more",
    "Better to ghost people than embarrassing yourself with deranged and desperate messages for help",
    "I am struggling so hard with ghosting lately. I go to the damn therapy. I take the goddamn meds.  Still so much struggling.\n\nI'm not sure if I trust my friends that stay, or not anymore.",
    "I have those, she never says no. I feel like crying because so many times I say no and make up excuses and she knows but she never retaliates.",
    "exactly, understanding and empathetic friends are hard to come by. I'm so glad i have the friends i do. i feel horrible for not reaching out more often, but they're so understanding!",
    "They're infinitely more valuable than gold",
    "Yes yes yes. I've had many friends that I've accidentally pushed away. I have this one friend that is always by my side. She doesn't even get hurt when I need space. She isn't the type to comfort me like a therapist or ask me about my day. She's always there and we laugh about the dumbest shit ever.",
    "[deleted]",
    "That's a great friend.",
    "Tell him or her how much it means to you.",
    "P.S. I'm sorry you have been going through that too, OP. Self isolation feels so right when one needs it in order to socially recharge, but can be so terrible if one isn't aware of the tipping point. I'm happy we both have people to welcome us back to the world.\n\nEDIT: Clarifying that I meant the second comment for OP and not for my multiple personalities.",
    "Try and maintain contact. I ghosted all of my good friends for so long over and over again that I\u2019ve lost all of them. I don\u2019t have any friends and I\u2019m middle-aged at this point. It\u2019s a miserable existence.",
    "I've received a few messages like that and they always make me cry. Typically they're from people who have personal experience with depression and understand the need to just not talk to anyone for a while. We are so fortunate to know people like that.",
    "It has taken me not months, but years with some friends I've lost due to my depression. I'm slowly building back relationships and yet I still feel that with some people I'll come out of the woodwork, only to be met by anger and resentment for not being there, especially the ones who have passed major milestone without me. I'm learning that people who truly care will always care, and forgiveness and compassion come hand in hand.\n\nI'll be thinking about you - please PM me if you want to talk.",
    "I fear the same thing. The last decade of my life has been a series of long periods of withdrawal and weepy reconciliations with some of the people I love. If I were on the receiving end I'm not sure what I would do. I hope your loved ones continue to show you empathy and understanding.",

    "It sounds like you're being as supportive as you can be, which is probably what she needs. *good vibes to you*",
    "Sometimes the best you can do is reach out with no expectation of a response, just to say you're thinking of them and want them to be well. Thank you for being the kind of friend who sticks around!",
    "I relate so hard to the building anxiety that comes with the passage of time between messages. For me, the longer I wait, the more I shame myself. The more I shame myself, the less likely I am to actually return the message.",
    "Hey, friend. Are you seeing a therapist right now? Your post history concerns me.",
    "It's also helpful for people like me who do this to hear the perspective of people like you who are impacted by it - I'm sorry you've been hurt. I hope reconciliation is on the horizon!",
    "I'm new to Reddit kinda, and I'm not sure how I'm able to respond, but I'm on the exact same boat.\n\nMy friend texts back once In a while (only twice) with just random tidbits, like saying she was \"okay\" but just didn't want to talk about it (first part was an obvious lie), or she'd respond \"happy new year\" after I said it. I also send her walls of text, but she doesn't respond to those seemingly.\n\nIn my eyes it's progress on her end, she's trying. \n\nI feel your exact feelings of dejection, concern because it's been almost a year, and all. Hope you guys are doing good though!",
    "I legitimately had a conversation with someone last night about this, and how hard and shameful it can feel to be the ghoster and feel like you have no adequate explanation. I am happy you reconnected also.",
    "In the age of social media there are ways to know one is *alive* without actually being in direct contact, just saying.",
    "YES, the tipping point. A lot of social media I follow is accepting of introverts and I think that's great, but for me it fostered this idea that what I was doing was just a manifestation of introversion and not severe depression. There is a fine line. Thank you for your input!",
    "Lol my friend had lost a bet the week prior and had to wax his entire torso. Honestly they do stuff like that all the time so no one thought to mention it to me because it's such a regular thing they kinda assumed of course I knew this was what's going on. It took the entire day to wax him, he is a very hairy man, and he still had a few patches that we missed.\n\nI guess I have managed to pay them back in a way? Most of us come from pretty dark places so we all kinda understand what it's like and just do our best to be there for each other. We've all taken care of each other the past few years.",
    "Thank you friend. I have not reached out to her at all. This was her decision. I just hope she knows she can reach out if she feels like she needs too. We were together for 2.5years, I thought she was the one, and I thought she was on the same page (we are both in our Mid/Late 20s).",

    "That definition of ghosting is debatable, and I think the message comes through just fine, though I appreciate you clarifying",
    "They are. I'm really lucky to have them, but I wish more people were like them. Everyone deserves friends like that. Especially the people in this sub.",

    "The thing is... somedays it\u2019s like a switch goes off, and you are happy and you feel like you can do all the things you tried so hard to the day before, but couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s where it gets confusing for me. Somedays I feel so good, like maybe if I just tell myself I can, I will.... but then it doesn\u2019t work like that and you feel like somethings wrong with yourself. Because I have good days, I feel like others look at me like there are just days I\u2019m sad and don\u2019t feel like it. But that\u2019s not the case. I don\u2019t find any of it to cute or quirky. I don\u2019t like the vivid shaking that comes with the anxiety, or the entire sickness that overloads my body during a panic attack, or the fact that somedays I lay in bed crying because I just want to get up and shower, but can\u2019t find the energy to get out of bed. Depression. Anxiety. They suck. More people need to talk about the truth of what really goes on. How we truly feel. The more we speak up about the darkness that it truly is, I feel the less people will look at it as something cute and quirky. They will have a better understanding of what it truly is.",

This post is meant to come from a good place and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s relatable to many others, but I know it would make others feel invalidated. I had a patient who was able to function and even appear to do well to those around him. Even I was fooled by how well adjusted he seemed compared to others I had seen.

I work part time and earn 50k a year, save money, keep my house clean, shower daily etc etc. \n\nSome people do use depression as an excuse to avoid responsibilities, abuse people around them,  mooch financially off people, and generally be lazy. If people have the option not to do something, many won't. I have had someone who was very lazy sponge off me (ex husband) in the name of depression. Yet I was diagnosed with major depression, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, OCD, psychosomatic symptoms plus real health issues and I still worked and took care of basic responsibilities. Despite having been in inpatient psychiatric units, nearly dying, etc etc. So because some people use it as an excuse to be lazy, that's where some of the stigma comes from. \n\nDepression may be an illness, just like my thyroid disease or vertigo I have. But there is still choice - to get up, shower, work, whatever. It's a choice. Depression and various other health issues make that hard, trust me I know. But depression diagnosis should not be viewed as an automatic get out of jail free card where you can ditch all responsibilities and not have anyone pissed off at you or criticizing your lack of discipline. \n\nDepression for me tends to be a very deep sadness where I cry every day and I can't see the point in anything. It's not an absence of feelings for me, I'm more of a wreck, crying and feeling I'm having a nervous breakdown and will suffocate. It's different to my anxiety in that it feels like sadness and grief and not panicky. I have mininal energy and struggle with all tasks including getting out of bed. I use alcohol to cope. I can't control my thoughts or feelings, but I  can control my actions. I am imperfect but on tge outside, my life does not look stereotypically like a severely depressed person, which is part of why professionals don't/won't help me. Despite my history of not leaving the house for 5 years or living in a psych unit, they feel that because I go to work then I must be okay but I am not okay. You get punished in a way for being high functioning with depression, then have to put up with others claiming depressed people can't do anything or have responsibilities. So people with depression may feel hard done by that people judge them for checking out. But I've checked out completely and also been high functioning.. and I can tell you that people actually do have more compassion for the checked out types than someone who's living a \"normal life\" but drinks 500ml of liquor a day or cries non stop. Then you're just viewed as unstable or an addict rather than a depressed person who's trying hard. ",

    "I\u2019ve been depressed ever since I was little. It pisses me off seeing people post quotes and shit on Facebook or instagram about how they are depressed and have no body. All just fucking too sorry for themselves. Cos they got rejected or got told of by their parents. These people are fake they don\u2019t understand depression. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to think about how they would kill themselves everyday. They don\u2019t know the self-hatred. Or the constant existential nihilism that arises whenever something has to be done. They don\u2019t know; how drug overdoses feel, how the throbbing pressure in your face feels as you tied a noose around your neck, how the coarse sting of bleach feels in the throat and how it leaves you with acid reflux for your whole life, or how you have to plan out your outfit to hide scars rather than how it looks.  Ik some people mean well and try to spread awareness but that in itself is ignorance. Telling people they need to talk to someone like they believe that the person has the ability to do so. And no for some people nothing helps. Nothing. No amount of counselling or medication will ever distract them from the fact that their life up until this point has been so painful that they have no hope for the future of it. People can go round preaching about how they were once depressed and how one day their brain just snapped out of it, maybe because of medication or because they found someone they loved. But really they\u2019ve just bought into the delusion that their whole life isn\u2019t really meaningless. For some of us we can only drown our pain in materialistic possessions and in our love for others for so long. The fact is love isn\u2019t real it\u2019s an ideal. It\u2019s lust or desire in disguise. Everyone masks it as some irrational power but it\u2019s not it\u2019s completely rational and we are just too afraid to admit it because if we do we\u2019d all realise there\u2019s nothing for us here. So yeah I\u2019m 18 and depressed, and have anxiety, PTSD, drug induced psychosis, and also an unbreakable psychological addiction to drugs. Ik exactly why I have depression and it\u2019s not because I\u2019ve had terrible life experiences, although those probably made it worse, it\u2019s because I inherited it genetically from two severely depressed parents. It\u2019s in my brain and I can\u2019t escape it. I can\u2019t have it conditioned out of me it\u2019s basic brain chemistry serotonin, dopamine. Medication could\u2019ve helped though. If only I wasn\u2019t self medicating years before. Taking ecstasy, weed. Benzos, opiates, alcohol regularly, fuck I even huff fucking deodorant when my supply is dry just because drugs are literally all I have left now. Now my brains even more fucked up and it\u2019s probably likely I\u2019ve lost in some capacity the ability to feel joy. I have no sex drive, no aspirations, nothing I\u2019m just living my last days in a frenzy of excess. Distracting myself with material items and drugs I can\u2019t even afford. I\u2019ve burnt through thousands of \u00a3s in the last few months and I don\u2019t even pay for anything because I live with my parents. I don\u2019t have a job and I just scrape together what money I can earn from selling drugs to afford drugs. I\u2019m living my last few days/ weeks and I only have to wait now until the right time. I have a plan. And I\u2019m slowly coming to terms with the pain of death from my other attempts so my fear is declining. I just have a few more things to do and unless some miracle happens and my mind is fixed by something I\u2019m pretty sure I will finally get to die. Shit this is a long ass comment thanks if you bothered to read this shit. There\u2019s a little insight into what proper depression is. It wasn\u2019t meant to go on that long and looking back at it the motivation may have been that I have a lot of emotion that I\u2019ve kept to myself for a while now and for some reason this post triggered its release. However, this does not mean that I made this shit up. I have been diagnosed with all those disorders/ issues by a healthcare professional so I don\u2019t want to see any dick head comments saying I\u2019m bullshitting.

People with MDD can't even get out of bed, they call out of work all the time, they're sad all the time etc...\" \n\nReally?? So what I've been dealing with for a few years now is a normal response? I told him that my depression can come out in sadness, irritation, emptiness etc. And then I mentioned all of my other symptoms (and I have MOST of them). Just because I manage to haul my ass to work doesn't mean I'm not depressed. It's not even like I perform super well there. I get super irritable/sad and I've had countless breakdowns, it's at the point where I couldn't even tell you how many times I've broken down. Although I have been on this medication for almost 2 months now which has seemed to decrease my break downs, but before that..it would happen often. \n\nHe just made me doubt myself even more when I've been having feelings of self doubt for years now.

It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot.

I wasn\u2019t functioning when I wasn\u2019t self medicating and Suboxone keeps me level, fills my opiate receptors so I don\u2019t crave them and has naloxone in it so I know if I were to try to get high off another opiate or take too much of it I would get sick. There have been studies done that show that Suboxone could be used successfully to treat the symptoms of treatment resistant depression. [Low dose Suboxone for treatment resistant depression and suicidal behaviour ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121503/#!po=17.5532) [Suboxone off-label use for treatment resistant depression ](http://blumsrewarddeficiencysyndrome.com/ets/articles/v1n1/jrdsas-021-george-kamajian.pdf) \n\nHave you been \u201ctested\u201d for other mental health disorders? Bipolar? Borderline Personality disorder? [Borderline personality disorder symptoms](https://www.psycom.net/depression.central.borderline.html) [Bipolar symptoms ](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/bipolar-disorder/bipolar-disorder-signs-and-symptoms.htm/) I was misdiagnosed and was recently diagnosed with Bipolar. I hate that it\u2019s a lifelong illness and the stigma attached to it...but it\u2019s treated different than depression and the antidepressants I was given had been making my symptoms worse. If antidepressants haven\u2019t worked for you...again, mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics. Hell CBD oil has worked wonders for a family member with severe depression. \n\nAs for life being repetitive once you get older...I\u2019m not challenging you, I just want you to know that I was severely suicidal during my teenage years and felt like the rest of my life couldn\u2019t hold anything much more exciting than what I\u2019ve already done. But here are some of the things I\u2019ve found that have given me hope. Travel...have you traveled? Everywhere? Even if you don\u2019t think you like travelling there is something amazingly fulfilling about even just getting in a car and driving...anywhere. Somewhere beautiful preferably. If you feel like you\u2019ve experience everything, try going somewhere you wouldn\u2019t think of...Indonesia, Egypt, Alaska, Iceland. My goal is Tonga...you can swim with motherfucking humpback whales. that\u2019s too much, try somewhere local. If you are in or near Canada, British Columbia is amazing...beautiful and interesting, you can go and sleep in your car, camp or stay somewhere fancy. Victoria Island, Vancouver, Tofino, Whistler. You can see Orca whales there too! [BC beauty ](https://www.hellobc.com) Banff and Jasper in  Albert are amazing [Banff things to do](https://www.banfflakelouise.com/things-to-do) You can rent ski equipment (have you gone skiing or snowboarding?) or sit by a waterfall, hike in the mountains. \n\nThe top one on my \u201cto do\u201d list is volunteering with Helpx...because travel can be too expensive sometimes. With this all you have to pay for is getting there usually. Basically you choose anywhere in the world you\u2019d like to visit and they have listings for work in exchange for board and meals. So you could go to Bali, or Canada, or somewhere close to home...stay somewhere for free in exchange for doing some sort of work. Often the jobs are super interesting if you click on any of the travel links, this is the one to click. [Travel and experience your destination for super cheap](https://www.helpx.net/hostlist.asp?host_region=987&network=9) \n\nDo you like music? Have you seen all of your favourite musicians live? It\u2019s worth it in my opinion, I\u2019ve gotten to see a few of mine. \n\nSometimes when you feel like there is absolutely no point in living, helping someone else can give you meaning. Maybe you\u2019d like to someday help teenagers get the help they need? That doesn\u2019t mean going to university for years to get a degree, it could be volunteering with an organization that helps underprivileged youth. If you like animals it could be fostering dogs/cats that would otherwise be put down. It could be volunteering/working at a senior home. Maybe if you try one of the treatments you haven\u2019t tried yet you might get to a better place mentally and physically you could go to school for addictions counselling, or study psychology to help other people that need it desperately. Suicide and crisis hotlines need volunteers. When I feel like I can\u2019t life for myself I try to live for someone else. Whether it be my parents, or people I don\u2019t know that need help. \n\nFrom the sounds of your post there\u2019s one major thing you haven\u2019t experienced that is worth waiting to...and that\u2019s waking up without a hangover or in withdrawal and having hope. I\u2019ve had it a few times and it\u2019s fucking worth it. To stand outside on a sunny day, feel the warmth on your face and feel calm inside. I know it feels impossible now. But right now you seem to have convinced yourself there is no hope or helping you. If you give yourself one more chance, and put everything you have into doing everything you can...then at least after everything you can say you exhausted all of your options. I know it\u2019s exhausting. I know what it\u2019s like to have a dysfunctional family, how it feels to wake up and have the first thing that crosses your mind be \u201chow can I get high, what do I have, I need it now\u201d I didn\u2019t think I would ever get past that. It took me until I was 25 to and I\u2019m only 26. \n\nAgain, please don\u2019t think I\u2019m dismissing your pain. It is valid. Im so sorry you are going through this. There can be hope, but you have to allow yourself to think there is hope. \ud83d\udc95\n",

    "In all honesty, we need better vocabulary.  The two aren't related at all, but because we use the same words everyone who's been sad for a couple of days thinks medical depression is the same as that.  Then they can get better by doing things like leaving the house with friends and think it works on medical depression.",
    "Thing is I\u2019m not physically addicted to a single substance. I\u2019m mentally addicted to not being sober. I\u2019ve done so many different drugs because I get bored quickly and my tolerance builds up to fast for it to be cost effective. Whenever I do anything the first thing I think is, I wish I was high rn. Whenever I go out to a restaurant, I\u2019ll smoke weed cos it\u2019s better. Whenever I party, I\u2019ll drink till I drop and then pop pingerz or do blow till I wake back up. I\u2019ve tried separating myself from drugs and it\u2019s all I think about. Even when I try to quit I\u2019ll end up drinking the smoking because everything is just better. In my experience there\u2019s literally a drug for every occasion. In my GCSE art exams I did ecstasy. If I\u2019m doing a presentation for class I\u2019ll take like half a xan and a couple shots then maybe also take ecstasy to perk up my energy levels. I can feel my body dying and I\u2019m only 18. I get headaches nearly everyday even when I\u2019ve been sober for a week I\u2019ll get mild stomach cramps all the time. Mentally I feel like I\u2019ve done as much damage as you can possibly do from drugs. My serotonin is long gone from multiple week long binges of ecstasy. I have HPPD from whatever idek probably 2cb. I have psychosis from chronic abuse of weed and stimulants. Luckily I\u2019m scared of heroin and shit cos I\u2019ve watched too many documentaries but I\u2019d be lying if I said I haven\u2019t considered it. There\u2019s just no point whatever I do I\u2019ll never be satisfied. Yeah I\u2019ve travelled but I can\u2019t do that anymore because I\u2019ll just get bored from not being able to get high. Plus because of my PTSD and anxiety I don\u2019t feel safe anywhere but in my room. I get anxiety when my parents speak to me so leaving the house makes me feel sick on a daily basis unless I smoke weed. I have even started carrying knives and stuff because I\u2019m afraid for my life when I leave the house. So not only am I paranoid of normal people but I\u2019m paranoid of teachers and police. I don\u2019t trust a single person not even my girlfriend. I was convinced that my best friend was trying to steal from me and I was convinced my other friend was trying to manipulate me and control my mind. I can\u2019t handle shit anymore. There\u2019s honestly no alternative. My doctor might prescribe diazepam for my anxiety and I\u2019ll just abuse that until I run out and I\u2019ll be back to where I was in a couple days. There\u2019s honestly no hope for me anymore. Whatever I do everything will continue to get worse. I\u2019m slowly losing everything I\u2019ve ever loved. 5 members of my family have died in the last four years. My family is barely scraping through financially. I\u2019ve been kicked out of 3 high schools and now I\u2019m in college and I\u2019m about to be kicked out again. I\u2019ve got no friends because I don\u2019t trust anyone. My dad doesn\u2019t give a fuck about me. My mums too depressed in herself to even recognise that fact that I\u2019m slowly killing myself. I regularly go months without speaking to my brother because I have no relationship with any of my family anymore because they sent me of to boarding school at a young age where I was beaten up, bullied and abused all the time for three years. Honestly there\u2019s one person in the whole world that gives a fuck about me and that\u2019s my girlfriend but I don\u2019t really love her like that anymore but I\u2019m just scared to break up with her because her Dad just died a month ago and I want to be there for her but the stress of keeping up a relationship that I don\u2019t even think I want to be in for nearly a year is making me go insane. I don\u2019t even know what I want anymore I just need it all to stop and the only things that have ever worked were drugs and now they\u2019re making everything worse. My only life aspiration is to become famous and rich so I can do more drugs and buy pointless shit but I know that won\u2019t happen and even if it does I\u2019m still gonna kill myself anyway because really there\u2019s no point in life. I\u2019m not special I\u2019ll never have an impact on anyone\u2019s life for the better. I\u2019m so unmotivated to do anything and whenever something bad happens the first thing I think is \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter anyway cos I can just kill myself\u201d. I\u2019ve tried to get better I really have. I quit drugs for like six months but I was still depressed. If I\u2019m like this now at the age of 18 imagine the state I\u2019ll be in, in a couple years. I\u2019ll be homeless and then I\u2019ll just kill myself. I may as well just end it now. Weird thing is I don\u2019t even feel sad anymore. I used to. But now I have realised that the only real option I have is to kill myself. At least then I get to choose how much pain I go through.\n\nThanks for speaking to me. Felt really good to actually talk to someone. You\u2019re a nice person. You deserve a good life. Be happy.",

    "THANK YOU! you have no idea how much this means!",
    "yes! having the support of my friends, family, and s/o was & is crucial. being able to talk openly and without judgement is so important. find yourself a few close friends who you can count on and whatever you do, don\u2019t bottle it up. it\u2019s not healthy, and it\u2019ll backfire. people care. you just gotta find those people. ",
    "first of all, i want you to know that relapsing is okay and i don\u2019t want you to beat yourself up over it. it happens, we can\u2019t always be super strong. it\u2019s an addiction and it\u2019s hard so don\u2019t blame yourself or beat yourself up over it. \n\nsecondly, you will not always fail. you will, occasionally fail, and have down days and days that feel like even getting out of bed is too hard and on those days, just feel it. it\u2019s okay to feel like shit and to cry and to just be a mess. you gotta know how crappy it can be before you can see how amazing life can be. not everything is going to go perfectly in life and you will inevitably be thrown curve balls, so roll with the punches, and remind yourself that your feelings are valid, and not to try to cover them up or bottle them up, it\u2019ll just make it worse. \n\nthird of all, i made it to five years despite being raped twice, a psych ward visit, the death of my uncle, both my parents having heart attacks, being cheated on in one relationship and then again in another, and two gruelling hospital stays in which i was deadly ill. it has not been easy. it has been so hard. but i am a very firm believer that what doesn\u2019t kill you, makes your stronger. how you survive is what makes you who you are. every time a shitty thing happened to me, i\u2019d look at myself in a mirror and go \u201cok. this blows. i hate this. but just think about how much stronger and wiser i\u2019ll be after i go through this. think about how much more knowledge i\u2019ll have and god forbid should i have to go through it again, ill know what to do and how to cope. and maybe i can help someone else in the process.\u201d i suggest listening to a song called \u201csurvive\u201d by a band called rise against. it\u2019s gotten me through some of the hardest moments in my life. but knowing that one day i\u2019ll make it out to the other side all the wiser and stronger is worth it. it\u2019s so worth it. \n\nand fourthly, surround yourself with people, friends, family, a s/o who you can trust and rely on. find someone or some people who are non judgmental and who will listen. if you can\u2019t find anyone, then you found me and i will be that person for you. i mean it. having the support of other people is so key and so important. just like i\u2019m sure you want to help other people, they want to help you. don\u2019t bottle it up, don\u2019t keep it on the inside, it\u2019ll only end in something bad. let it out. be open. cry. scream. punch a pillow. rant to someone. they care. \n\nhope this helps homie. ",
    "definitely wasn\u2019t easy! but what helped the most was having undying support from some friends, and my family. when my roommate saw my scars and fresh cuts, she wrote up a tally chart for me and each day i didn\u2019t self harm, we would tick off the tally. seemed silly at first but one day turned into two, two into three, three into four and so on, and then all of a sudden it was 50 days. after that i just wanted to keep the momentum up! \nhaving someone to talk to, whether it was my roommate, my friends, my s/o, was crucial. \ni found that being able to openly talk and be able to communicate my feelings without being judged was so important too.

    "sure is!! five years is a long time. ",
    "The way I like to look at it is that \u201clife is like a video game\u201d. I usually use Pok\u00e9mon because that\u2019s what I know. Your mental illness is like all the Pok\u00e9mon that hide in the grass and you have to battle. Sometimes that can be a real pain in the ass. Then you start leveling up or you move to a different area and the random fights get easier. They\u2019re still annoying and you still have to deal with them but they\u2019re just part of getting through.  \nBasically, you have to struggle through a level sometimes but as long as you stick with it, even if you get set back because something didn\u2019t go right, you\u2019re still gaining EXP and learning. As long as you keep putting one foot in front of the other, you\u2019re still getting somewhere that\u2019s not here. ",

    "Very true. I did dance for just under 10 years, was taking multiple classes a week and some on the weekends. I loved it. I wanted to be a professional dancer one day. At the start of my freshman year of high school when the new dance season started, which would have been my 10th, I just remember one day waking up and suddenly I wasn\u2019t excited to go to dance anymore. Of course there were always some days where I didn\u2019t want to because I was tired but this was different. When I thought about dance I didn\u2019t get the same feeling I did before. I remember crying to my dad in the car and saying I didn\u2019t want to anymore. I couldn\u2019t understand why. I was so upset to give it up, reaching the 10 year milestone in my studio was a big deal, they gave you a special shoutout during the recitals and everything. I couldn\u2019t wait for the day I was a senior in high school and I got to do the special dance with the other high school seniors to honor them as we \u201cgraduated\u201d from the studio. And then one day I just... didn\u2019t care anymore. Looking back I know now it was because I was in the height of my depression. I became severely depressed in 8th grade, although I had signs of depression and anxiety for much much longer. I still miss it a lot and one day I hope to take some adult classes once a week just to do it again but I\u2019ll never get back to the level I was before and that makes me so sad because I worked so hard to get to that point. Losing interest in a hobby is normal but if you suddenly lose interest in a hobby that you really love and you can\u2019t explain why, don\u2019t be afraid to seek some help and counseling to help you work through it.",
    "I used to read about three whole novels in a single month when I was younger. Now I haven't even touched a book in almost two years.\nI tried getting back into it but I can't seem to concentrate.

    "That..... explains a lot.",
    "well I do feel like I'm depressed, but am I really? like loosing all motivation to do things even the ones you loved doing because it feels like a chore and you end up literally sitting staring blankly at your surroundings and wasting hours of your time doing nothing, sure makes me feel like I'm depressed but I also thought it was because of my bad habit of being able to stop what I'm doing no matter how interesting it is, without the desire of ever wanting to go back to it, but thinking about it now, that can also be because of depression, but you don't really know without the diagnosis, right? anyways since I can't bring myself to do even the things I enjoy, it's especially hard to do the things I don't want to, so when I can't bring my self to do them, I just say I'm irresponsible, because saying something like \"I had no motivation to do it\" feels ridiculous lol",

I can't watch tv, or go on my phone for longer than a few minutes. I can't look after myself properly because it's just too much, even though it's not... I can't do pretty much anything for longer than a few minutes because my mind is just too preoccupied. I can't sleep for the same reason . \nIs life even worth living when it's like this?\nHow do people get through it?",

I still spend time on my hobbies, but it\u2019s more as an escape / because I\u2019ve already invested money/time/effort in them, than because I\u2019m actually enjoying them.

    "I hate and love that fact at the same time",
    "would you say sporadic interest is also a sign? jumping from one activity to the next, eventually going back to it?",
    "I've been feeling the same lately. It feels like I'm in an in between, between depressed and not depressed, and I just can't make the jump to not depressed. I don't feel the heavy weight that's so familiar to me, the one that I'm sure is depression. But I don't feel okay either. I feel like I'm too taxed to care about much, and I just need a break from the world to recover. It's just a lack of energy and motivation that's easily confused with laziness.",
    "Sorry for the info dump but i want to talk about this. When i was 12 i met a girl who was a year older than me, but still in my year group because she had moved from australia and had to be held back.

I promise I will do it myself as well. \n\nHere is your Build a Hug Kit. \n\n***Edit: This is a unisex kit, good for all ages. Modify as desired.***\n\n1. Take some wisdom from Temple Grandin, who came up with her \u201chug machine\u201d through acute need of the feeling  of being firmly enfolded in a safe place. \n\nBuild a little fort to fit your body. Make it inviting and calmly stimulating to all your senses. \n(Edible smells, comforting smells to *you*, different pleasant textures, gently firm borders on all sides and also, weight on top of you (safely) Make sure your feet will be encapsulated in your wrappings, but safely. Don\u2019t let me encourage you to truss yourself up so well  that you wake up with a need to visit the loo, and somehow you can\u2019t move. \n\nDon\u2019t become yet another victim of my over enthusiasm :0\n\nYou are constructing a shape like this: )( with you inside the middle. \n\nWith\n a gentle rumble-buzz in the background:\n\nThis music could be awesome in a hug-fort. \n[Here it is](https://youtu.be/LFGsZ6ythQQ)\n\nIf you could have some soft lights just somehow overhead (mini Xmas lights?) that would be great. Candles would make me nervous. Murphy\u2019s Law has overwhelmed many of us of late, yeah, don\u2019t risk it. \n\nSo: all your pillows, cushions, stuffthatworksforthis (books, suitcases, plastic storage bins) in place and ready to be put just right. House and everyone all set for the moment if you fall asleep? Awesome. \n\nClimbing into your fort, arrange it all about you. Enjoy tiny choices. Music? Silence? Lots of light to none? In this safe place, *Each choice you make is a hug you are giving yourself.* No need to second guess yourself in a hug-fort. \n \nI\u2019ve stuffed a bulky coat or jacket and hugged it before, if that helps, also. \n\nNow, in your fort, think of all the people here who sent you hugs. Imagine all of us laughing and doing the squeeze-the-bread hug, release, squeeze, release...\nImagine us all doing a conga line and hugging. Doing the bunny hop and hugging. Imagine us all just gently draping an arm over each other, so comfortable with each other that the only sound is soft intakes and exhales of air. \n\nAll this that you imagine is actually  truth. You know because you read the messages. \n\nu/nutmeg_toast : Thank you for helping me  today by reminding me to remember how to self-comfort. \nThank you for your post because I saw you in me and that sent me off to find the hug machine. Along the way, I found this great poem and a new ( for me) type of melodic mental help that I had never experienced before. You are struggling. By sharing,  you are out there helping. \n\nKeep going. \n\nFinally: \nI will not play at tug o' war.\n\nI'd rather play at hug o' war,\n\nWhere everyone hugs\n\nInstead of tugs,\n\nWhere everyone giggles\n\nAnd rolls on the rug,\n\nWhere everyone kisses,\n\nAnd everyone grins,\n\nAnd everyone cuddles,\n\nAnd everyone wins.\n\n\u2014Shel Silverstein,  Hug O War poem",

    "Hugs are fine but people need to get real with life. Life won't ever give you a hug. Life is tough and full of suffering. We must be mentally tough so as to come in terms with the challanges of life. Being a soft person begging for love online won't help you. It might give you momentarily satisfaction. It won't heal your pain. You must be selfish and love yourself first. If you love yourself, you don't need love but you can give more love. Nobody loves a person who doesn't love themselves. Love yourself the most. Everything else is secondary.",

    "That the way I ended my jobs all the time, the thing is I didn't enjoy the job myself and worked as a haft of the heart. And as a person with pride, it's hurt, but I couldn't force myself to try harder. I was out of will power at the first second I was in the office. \n\nThen I realized it was not just the jobs, it was the whole system that included people that I had to encounter every day. I didn't have any common interest with them. I see life in a totally different way. I didn't feel the aliveness in any one of them. So I social with barely a fraction of my heart, and again, it's hurt.\n\nThat's why I stopped doing any kind of that, even before the pandemic, I already keep myself in quarantine. The dog is the only creature that I can handle.\n\nI still hope it just because I haven't found the right community I belong to. I don't know how to help, so good luck!",
    "I feel like that all the time. Other people have jobs, multiple hobbies, *and* a social life. I, on the other hand, need about three hours just to wake up in the morning and by the time I have completed all the basic, most necessary tasks, it's already evening again.",
    "Me too. I can\u2019t handle more than one thing a day really, for example if I have school then I can\u2019t come home and do homework, or if I have work I can\u2019t come home and chores. Like I just physically cannot do it and idk why. God forbid I have work after school, bc I can\u2019t avoid that and I\u2019ll be half asleep driving home.

The people around you seem like they're cut out for work because they act like they are, not because they really are. I mean they are, but you are too as much as them, it's really comes down to mentality. If you think you're not cut out for life then you'll struggle more, and rather if you think you're smart and can do anything that comes your way, then it'll be easier and seem more doable.",

I say that, not to try to downplay your feelings or their importance but rather to emphasize that *you are not alone*. It's like this for all of us, to a greater or less extent, because mental illness never makes it *easier* for someone to cope with the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.\n\nYes, I feel like that.

First, yes, I definitely do feel like I should be accomplishing more than I do all the time, or even less than I used to. \n\nFor some of us, maybe it's just that the standard we're setting is too high. We always want to present ourselves in the best light, so when your coworkers are telling you about all their accomplishments, remember you don't have to consider that some standard. At least some of those people are probably exaggerating a bit. \n\nI like to be left alone, so when I talk to people I tend to stress how busy I stay so that I hopefully avoid situations where they expect me to be available cause I have nothing to do.

    "Yes! I have felt very much the same way this whole year. I am trying out therapy to see if there is anything to learn that way, but have only been to one session so far so it\u2019s too soon to tell what comes of that. So far on my own I am learning that 1) others can be struggling beneath the surface even if they appear to be handling much more with ease, and 2) that I have some deep rooted anxiety and coping problems that have been exacerbated by the stress of the pandemic and working at home with kids. \n\nThe good news is that I\u2019m also finding that addressing the root of my problems seems to help with many symptoms all at once. On my good days, when I deliberately center myself and fight the confusion and the panic, I am able to calm down and focus and get a lot more out of my time. The picture of where I want to be seems less unreachable and more like a realistic possibility if I were to make keep going in such a way. Easier said than done, of course, but all that to say - you are not alone! It sounds like you are actively trying to figure it out and that takes guts. The place you want to be may not be as far as it seems. : )",

A lot of \u2018everyday\u2019 life isn\u2019t supposed to be a part of human life, a lot of it is nothingness and maybe you see that more than your colleagues.

I actually just looked at this subreddit for the first time, just now, because I am pretty much falling apart.",
    "Absolutely!  What you can handle is completely related to your health, and mental health is health.  Your brain is an organ like any other.  When you have the flu and you can barely get out of bed, cleaning the house becomes the equivalent of a marathon.  Depression turns mole hills into mountains because it takes far, far more self motivation, discipline and determination to do the simplest tasks.  Be immensely proud of whatever you accomplish when depressed.",

Don\u2019t feel bad about not being able to meet the daily expectations of our current system.",
    "Please I request you to not compare yourself to anyone. Listen to your body and honour it.

I work at a minimum wage retail job, and I\u2019ve lost all desire to work hard and be a good employee. I also struggle with lots of mental issues that I haven\u2019t figured out or been able to see anyone about. Mainly, I go through certain periods where it gets very bad and I am disconnected from reality. Going to work just feels like I\u2019m living in a really boring dream. Usually, I can pick myself up out of it. But, there was one occasion where it had gotten so bad that I ended up in the hospital for a few days. It\u2019s less of a work struggle, but more of a mental struggle. I believe it\u2019s a desire for change, and the fact that I\u2019m disappointed in myself for not doing much better than I am. Sometimes, it feels like you just can\u2019t keep up with life. So, yes, you are not the only one experiencing these issues.",

    "I\u2019m feeling this right now, and have for a few years. In high school I was a machine, had dual enrollment classes, work, internship, volunteer club. Not much in my social life but that was okay with me. I was sleepy but I felt good about it, I always got everything done when I said I would. But sometime in college I started not being able to do more than one productive thing a day basically. If I clean my house I didn\u2019t do homework, if I went to class, I didn\u2019t clean my house. My last semester I had to start working and even tho it was a stupid easy job it would knock all energy and motivation out of me and I had to pretty much scare myself straight with the reality of my financial position and shame myself by thinking of how embarrassing it would be not to graduate to finally finish my thesis project I\u2019d already delayed graduation for. I had a side job doing social media and I flaked too many times to count cause I had to prioritize my other job and I just couldn\u2019t handle both no matter how much *time* I technically had. and now after graduating I\u2019m working a new job that I truly enjoy but I\u2019m not full time yet. So I\u2019m working maybe 20 hours a week, I don\u2019t do the other job anymore, no school. Just maybe 4 hours of work a day (admittedly it\u2019s not an easy job but cmon 4 hours?) and cleaning my house. And I still find myself exhausted!  I really need to go full time and hopefully I will in the next few weeks, and at that time while my financial stress will go away, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m gonna get worse mentally /burn out because I can\u2019t handle it. Which would make me feel *quite* pathetic considering that 40 hours at work a week with no other responsibilities is the bare minimum I should be able to handle as a grown ass adult",
    "A good way of thinking about it for me is like living life on Hard Mode. You face the same challenges as everybody else but you don't have the tools readily available to hand to be able to deal with them so effectively, and it takes you longer to make your own tools.",
    "I'm 21yrs old, and I lost my job in March because of the virus and also I have chronic health issues that make it so bad, I can't even walk without a cane. My daily life is thinking about how I'm not cut out to support myself and if my fiancee breaks up with me I would have nothing to do except move into my moms house or go to a homeless shelter because I can't go back to work and I cant work as hard as I'm required to in order to support myself, and I will never be independent and I will never get a salary job and I will never have any accomplishment again to celebrate for myself and I will never be able to live without depending on someone to help me get out of bed or to help me pay my bills. Everybody in my life is encouraging me to forgive myself and to not be so hard on myself, my fiancee reassures me that he has no desire to leave me, he told me it's okay that I can't go back to work right now (when I lost my job in March it was because my job went on strike at the same time that I had pneumonia and they made me come into work with pneumonia and a mask and a fever before I got tested for COVID so my coworkers went on strike and advocated for me while I was home sick, but if the virus never happened and my job never went on strike, I would still be jobless because I was fainting every day at work and throwing up at work and there were times I had to leave work early and go to the ER and I was progressively less and less able to handle it every day) and that I need to be at home focusing on my health, but I am constantly upset that I don't contribute to the house and that my fiancee could find someone who can work and does contribute and also that I can't do it by myself and I will never be the successful person I hoped I would be. But I'm learning to forgive myself and be kind to myself and just thank myself for doing my best right now, and I think that maybe if you replace \"I can't handle all this work,\" with \"thanks, me, for tolerating this much given the circumstances\" maybe you'll feel less overwhelmed and more just comfortable with the amount of stuff you can handle, even if it's different than your coworkers. The hardest thing for me is not comparing myself to those who I think are better than me, I still struggle with that even to this day. But it's important to remember that your strengths are not the same strengths your coworkers have and that's perfectly valid.

Im currently procrastinating doing something i really have to do, but am just entirely tired of doing (even though its literally the core part of my degree).\n\nIm getting to the point where i feel like im just not cut out to do the same thing for several months at a time.

    "I feel exactly the same and for the longest time I thought I was just lazy compared to others. For me the thought alone of working Monday-Friday 8 hours a day is literally like jail.

As you mentioned, their handling of stress may be better\n2. They may be really happy in other areas of their lives\n3. Their job is right for them\n\nI'm not in a job I like, so I'm going back to study to change that.

The tasks you find exhausting, they complete with no effort. It\u2019s not that they know how to fight negative feelings and fatigue better than you, it\u2019s just that they aren\u2019t dealing with what you\u2019re dealing with.\n\n(I\u2019m aware there\u2019re people who seem energetic but in reality are deeply depressed, but everyone has different ways of coping with mental illness, some may find comfort and peace in keeping themselves occupied so they go through everyday life and work with no problem, others are dead inside and even having to breathe feels like too much work)",
    "Same - I was always sure there were others. I feel like a child and I'm pushing 40. Trying to start therapy again is a pain in itself, but it's just one thing after another lately. Have you felt like this since childhood? I can't remember a time where life felt natural or comfortable.",

Just relax Sendra. Each person you encounter is just as confused as you are. Some are just better at hiding their disorientation. And no, you aren\u2019t playing life on hard mode compared to everyone else either. In fact, we\u2019re all playing different games all the while sharing the space that this big floating rock in the universe provides.\n\nYou and I both have a different set of experiences and upbringing...so why would we approach life the same way?\n\nWould you expect a domesticated cat and one who grew up in the wild to do things the same? Of course not. Each domain helped both animals to cultivate a distinct set of tools. Tools in which are **incomparable**\n\nThere are some things the domesticated cat can do that it\u2019s counterpart couldn\u2019t even fathom...but if the house cat spends all it\u2019s time beating itself up because it can\u2019t catch a fish in a nearby stream the **same way** that the wild cat can...then it will just be wasting its time. In fact, it would be ignoring the fact that it can in fact catch said fish...but in its **own way**\n\nWow that was a lot of \u201cin facts\u201d lol\n\nI\u2019m sure that there are somethings you can do better than me and vice versa. But why does it matter? We have a *different* set of tools because we\u2019ve been hammering away at a dissimilar set of problems. So in this sense, it\u2019s not that everyone is handling life *\u201dbetter than you\u201d*, they are handling it **differently**. Your issue is that you are so busy admiring the life of others that you for whatever reason forget as to how amazing you are. Don\u2019t do that to yourself \ud83d\ude21\n\nFocus on your set of tools and which ways you can go about better cultivating them to address your life and most things will fall in place. \n\n**P.S:**\n\nI\u2019m sure a passerbyer you once knew assumed that you had everything together and went about their day thinking that everyone else had it figured out but them.\n\n *Anyways*\n\nI hoped this helped.

    "Time to start praying.",
    "Thanks. I tried to set up an appointment with a therapist for a consultation, but they were hard to get in touch with.. Which really lowered my motivation to schedule an appointment even more.\n\nI have been to 2 therapists in the past. One was garbage and I moved away from the other one before we made any real progress. I suspect I have some mental health issues, but I don't honestly know.\n\nI appreciate the tips though. I will go through that. Right now I just try to journal to help relieve some of this stress/anxiety.",
    "I feel a lot like this too.. I don't really \"click\" with my colleagues. They are so set on their professional development, while I'm just struggling to have enough motivation to do my basic tasks. I really don't like working in the tech field. It's better than the engineering field though.. I worked in engineering for 3 years and absolutely hated it. I had to quit because I had no motivation to learn/memorize any of the material.\n\nI have found a small community of climbers that help me keep sane, but that's about it.\n\nGood luck to you too",
    "I've found if you are waiting to find a job where you really click with the people you work with, you are going to be waiting a long time.

    "Yep, I feel this. I have many days like this where I can't even recall what I've done all day other than accomplish one task or just my morning ritual.\n\nIn this age of \"multi-tasking\" I feel like I am getting left behind. Unfortunately.\n\nMy biggest problem is setting my standards/expectations too high. I want to be able to master/learn all my hobbies at once simultaneously, where in reality, I don't think anyone can do it. Or at least, no one that I personally know can do it. Maybe you do the same thing?",
    "I understand completely. I have always been similar to this. Lately I have tried to \"push myself\" to be able to do more than one thing a day. It can be very hard to do and overwhelming at times.. Some days I do better than others.\n\nThanks for sharing",

I was in good physical health but now I realize it was a mental sickness. You should talk to a doctor about your issues and get into treatment right away\n\n  I mean, school is easy compared to the work place. I waited until years after I joined the workplace to start treatment. Not smart",
    "I agree with you. I think everyone has a different mentality towards work/play. I think that it can become exhausting to pursue so much at once at all times... I think I just need more breaks than others. Maybe because I am easily stimulated, idk. I usually try not to question it too much so that I don't create false narratives in my head.\n\nThanks for your insight",
    "Thanks. I appreciate your kind words. As I've aged, I've definitely noticed I can't force myself to do certain things... I'm definitely too harsh on myself about it though. \n\nI have to try to constantly remind myself that I can't master/learn/juggle everything at once..",

Meanwhile I am slow at work so I beat myself up for not being able to figure out all these things while simultaneously being a productive employee... I unintentionally drive myself crazy with my high expectations.\n\nI like being left alone too.. The major thing that triggered this post this morning was that we are doing a \"Weekly Spotlight\" at work where we highlight what a random staff member is doing at work and I am disappointed and anxious about it because I've been very slow at work lately... I work Support so when there aren't many support requests I just chill. Tbh, I get paid for 40 hours a week and work a maximum of 10 when I'm this slow.",
    "Thanks. Comparison does kill. I got off of social media about a month ago for this very reason. At work, they started doing a weekly spotlight of one employee each week where they fill us in on all the work they're doing. I think a lot of my insecurities are coming from this...  It's a company email sent out weekly so it isn't really avoidable. I think I just need to try not to read it/compare myself to it every Monday..\n\nI know I do \"a lot\" compared to others, but sometimes it is easy to get in the mindframe that you always need to \"do more\" no matter how much you are already doing.. I need to remember that I am doing enough for ME and that my expectations can be unrealistic sometimes.",

I would definitely say I have depression tendencies. I don't know about anything beyond that.\n\nI never considered that working more/doing more truly can very from person to person depending on their mental health situation. I've had a really hard past so I'm guessing that could be part of my \"inability\" to work or handle as much as others.\n\nThanks for sharing. I feel better after reading this.",
    "Thanks for the positive vibes. I certainly agree that everyday life is unnatural and uncomfortable. I guess the fakeness of life bothers me as well.",

    "I understand. I actually have a degree in Civil Engineering that I don't use anymore. I worked in the Civil Eng field for 3 years. I had 4 different jobs in that time period. I hated them all with the last job being THE WORST. (no exaggeration, they were micromanagers from hell).\n\nUnfortunately, our society does not help you envision what it's like to have a full time position in your future field. They only give you the loans and allow you to sign up for the classes. I just made the best \"logical\" decision I could which was to go for a degree in a stable market that would make decent money. Hopefully you don't regret your degree too much, but if you do, I understand. It feels really shitty to be stuck with a degree you don't like.",
    "Thanks. Yes, it's terrible that some people feel like they have to keep themselves that busy. Fortunately, I don't have to go to those lengths.. \n\nThis culture is definitely toxic for so many reasons. It's very unrealistic because we expect people to be able to juggle so many tasks/objectives yet remain perfectly fine with no mental health issues..",
    "I felt the same way when I worked minimum wage retail. I worked at Old Navy for 3-4 years. I would purposely ask off days/weekends before tests to allow myself to study for exams. I guess I wasn't very good at working to begin with. Now that I've been in the workforce for 4 years, it is becoming more and more clear. \n\nI can handle my current job situation alright, but it will probably exhaust me eventually. Good luck with your current job situation.",

I work support so if there aren't many support requests, I don't do anything.\n\nThis has been feeding my anxiety quite a bit because I always feel guilty that I can't handle more in my down time.. But also anxiety because I'm not doing more at work. A lot of my coworkers do \"professional development\" such as software training in their down time.. I just do household chores, read about hobbies, etc. since I work from home. Idk it's hard for me to feel content with anything I do.",
    "I resonate with this one.. I hate to be comparing or anything, but I honestly don't know anyone who relates to some of my struggles. I have to stop being so hard on myself.",
    "Thanks. That was really sweet of you to say. I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling with self love as well. It is so incredibly hard to love and accept ourselves in this day and age of selfies and superficiality. It is so easy to feel inadequate or unlovable because someone else is so much \"better\" or whatever it is.\n\nWe all have our different backgrounds and struggles and I have to remember that not everyone has it as easy as it seems.\n\nI'm 27. My mom moved to the Philippines when I graduated from college at 23. I saw my mom for a couple days in 2016 before she moved and a couple more days in 2018 when she came to visit the states. I have not seen a family member since then. My entire side of mom's family lives in the Philippines. I don't keep in touch with my dad's side of the family because they are \"crazy.\" Hell, even he didn't want to keep in touch with them. My dad died when I was 16. I guess my major struggle in life is my utter loneliness. I think that loneliness makes me feel unlovable/unworthy due to the love I never received from family. I'm trying to work on my self love as well.\n\nI really appreciate you sharing your struggles with me. I think that it really helps to hear what other people are struggling with too. Just to feel more human and feel like other people are more human too.",
    "Yes, I definitely do that sometimes. Typically it is I'm smarter or I'm just better at decision making than someone. Other times it's because I look better or take care of myself (fitness) better.\n\nThere's certainly something egoic and unhealthy about feeling better than others, but it does happen from time to time. It's good that you're at least aware of when you are doing it so that you can try to correct that thought process.\n\nWe should really be looking at each other as human beings. We all come from the same mold. There's technically no \"better\" or \"worse\" people from a true unbiased perspective. We are all the same.",
    "I burn out pretty quick too.. Life is exhausting. Try not to think of it as your shortcomings, this is really an issue with our society/system.\n\nEvolutionarily we were not sitting at desks doing boring busy work 40+ hours a week lol. Ultimately, the system we came up with is pretty meaningless. All we really need is food/water, shelter, and health. We don't really have to do any of this BS, we just agree to it. I think that this is the true reason why I'm so fast to burn out. Maybe it's the same for you too. Realistically, I would like to live in a commune and just do my job and live lol.",
    "You probably don't believe them because you don't value yourself/your feelings. I think that it is very possible that someone could be worried about you. It sounds like you may even need to be worried about yourself.\n\nDo you know the person well? Are they someone you like to share your feelings with? You also may just have problems trusting said person because you don't know them well enough. Would it change the situation if it was someone else who said they were worried about you? Would you be more/less trusting?",
    "Well, if you ever want to share, feel free to PM me. I am very non-judgmental so I wouldn't think twice about whatever is bothering you.",
    "Yeah, I think that I need to see a therapist to really figure out my mental health.. I've never really went to a therapist regularly for an extended period of time. My first therapist SUUUUCKED. My second therapist was good, but I moved away and lost coverage with that provider.\n\nI think I need to try again.. they always ay 'third times a charm'",
    "Most likely both. I'm in the same boat although I've never been diagnosed with any mental illness.. but I've also only been to a therapist a handful of times.",
    "Sometimes it's harder than other times.. Hopefully you are feeling better now/today than you did when you responded. Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk about it at all.",
    "Do you need to get a new job? Do you need to work in a new field? Or are you just going to feel this way regardless of what you do for work?\n\nI only ask because I was in the Civil Eng. field for 3 years. I tried 4 different jobs. I have a Civil Eng. degree... I fucking hated it. I eventually just had to quit my last job, and I haven't done Civil Eng. since.  I was absolutely miserable and anxious. My weekends were painful because all I could do was try not to worry about working again.. I couldn't sleep at night.\n\nI switched fields (software support for engineering software) and I feel a lot better than I used to. It's not ideal, but it's definitely an improvement.",
    "I think I like to keep myself busy doing my own things to help me cope. Working doesn't help at all.. Working feels overwhelming because it is unrelatable and mostly bullshit. I think that if I worked in a field that I really connected to I would feel a lot better, but I don't know how I would make that happen.\n\nI legitimately should probably see a therapist. I think that's what I'm really getting from your response and other's. I had a really shitty childhood followed by a very isolated/lonely adulthood.",
    "It comes and goes.. I have times where I can't even remember what it's like to be happy or what happiness is like. I will feel so down on myself and everything will feel incredibly overwhelming. I get to a point where I can't even make decisions anymore. Simple/meaningless decisions will feel huge. \n\nI'm sorry you feel that way. I know it is probably hard dealing with it for so long, but it sounds like you have been working on this for a while now so at least you are trying to address it. I am going to start trying therapy again too.. This will be my third try.",
    "Damn.. I hope that you're not on social media. I deleted social media about a month ago. Obviously I'm not doing amazing, hence the anxious/overwhelmed post, but I am doing quite a bit better than before.\n\nI had a tendency to compare myself to people far too much and social media was very distracting. I couldn't keep my train of thought and would often find myself looking for distractions. I can maintain more focus lately since deleting it. Also I am generally comparing myself to people a lot less without Facebook & Instagram. I would recommend deleting those things if you have them. Even things that didn't necessarily hurt me, were still hurting me. The politics, the bickering, etc.. It's just not a great environment.",
    "Haha I appreciate your humor. I deleted FB/instagram a month ago which helped a lot.\n\nI try to do those things, but sometimes I am juggling a lot so it gets overwhelming. I appreciate your friendly reminders.. I need to get back into meditation and more yoga.",

It is hard to remember this in the moment.. I always forget how amazing I am. Not in an egotistical way, but much like you said, I have went through some crazy shit and I am handling it in my own way, the best I can, which is amazing.\n\n> I hoped this helped. Take care of yourself person\n\nIt did help. This reminds me of why I removed myself from social media (minus Reddit). I was doing too much comparing and not enough self appreciation. I've heard of people doing gratitude exercises.. I think I should start doing those.",
    "I\u2019m sorry your motivation has been affected by the providers you\u2019ve tried to interact with so far. Please don\u2019t stop looking if possible! I tried all sorts of resources and types of providers before I found my current therapist. (Been my provider for 4 years now). Finding my current therapist made the previous search and slog feel all the more worth it.  It\u2019s totally ok to try people with different clinical backgrounds and it\u2019s understandable to ask for a different practitioner. Sometimes people just aren\u2019t a good fit.",
    "Thank you!",
    "Hi, thanks for your reply. I don't wait to find a right job actually, I did it before and also tried to convince myself what you just said but I get my mechanism running in different principle, I can not do anything if I don't feel it genuinely, I can not spend 8 hours/day doing something that I don't really care and subsequently I know it affect other and damaging my seft-esteem. It not only hurt me, it hurt other and it has been proven strongly. For me, work is not just work, it can be not fun and nice, but at least, I have to feel it valueable.\n\nSorry, I'm kind of obstinate. All the best for you!",
    "I sometimes tend to set unrealistic goals for myself, yes. But I don't think a goal like \"practice your drawing skills for 30 minutes a day\" is that unrealistic but, like every task, it takes me about 4 hours to start doing something that takes 30 minutes.",
    "Lol I\u2019ve been to two therapists, I wish I could say it helped",
    "I feel like that too. I'm taking online classes right now and it's really difficult to get into a good work ethic especially when i can just cheat on most things. People in the discords i frequent for school seem like they have everything under control and everything's easy but i try to just excuse that as them being tryhards. Good for them they're able to get so much work done but at the end of the day I'd be more happy if I could just sit and play games online with my friends rather than study all night.",
    "Yes - schizoaffective can have less destructive psychosis but tend more toward comorbidity with personality disorders and depression, anxiety. \n\nPersonally I'm willing to take the hit in income if it means I can handle myself better. It might even put in the end in terms of costing me less in meds, or self-medication expenses...\n\nAnyway glad this helped! Everyone has to figure out how to best care for themselves and there should be flexibility there.",
    "Thanks.  I think my issue might be different from yours.  In your case, it may just be a case of \u201ceveryone is different\u201d, or people are just dealing with different issues behind the scenes. Yeah some people can handle way more stuff at one time.  I see this all of the time, and I am definitely on the low end of my team on this.  On the other hand, you can probably handle much more than other people would in your situation.  In my case, we try to hire new people for my group and they often don\u2019t cut it, or some of the new employees that stay end up not carrying much of a load.  I can look at those employees and see that I handle much more.  It\u2019s not hard to find people that can do more or less than I can, so I guess it is all relative.\n\nMy issue is definitely depression and anxiety, and I feel like it has chipped away at my mind over the years where I don\u2019t think I can handle it all anymore.  I need to make a change but I also afraid to that.  If I can\u2019t handle my current job, will I be able to handle a new situation?",
    "Unless one of your goals is to move up the ladder, and that goal outweighs other goals you are actively working on I don\u2019t think you should feel guilty about doing things you enjoy rather than professional development shit. If that\u2019s what they value, that\u2019s wonderful for them but if that\u2019s not what you want to put your time into there\u2019s no reason to do it. My goal is to have a job where I come home and I\u2019m done so I can paint or play animal crossing or read a book when I get home. My goal right now is not to juggle lots of things cause that doesn\u2019t make me happy in the slightest anymore. So if you feel restless, id suggest  doing more things you enjoy, it doesn\u2019t have to be productive by capitalistic standards to make you feel productive and better. When I was furloughed from covid I got that kinda unproductive anxiety but it was because I was just sleeping and watching Netflix. When I did things I actively enjoyed, like doing my nails or art or going for walks and taking pictures, I get a reprieve from that guilt anxiety.",
    "I also think about every person on the street and every other person in my life is just a normal person with a happy life and of course they wear clean clothes and they shower normally and they have a balanced work/social life and they don't do self-destructive things and they have a standard level of self-respect, but honestly all those people are, for the most part, on TV and any person you see walk past you on the street is not that perfect, so it's unrealistic for you and me to also have those standards for ourselves even if they are technically healthy goals. Family is important to have close to you and it's really really hard to have a relationship with your parents and they aren't there. I moved 10 miles away from my mom and I'm an adult man now and I wasn't close with my Mom growing up so I would never really classify myself as a \"momma's boy\" too much, or at least I wouldn't have growing up, but I think often \"I want my mom right now\" and I always think about what I'm going to do if she dies before I do. I couldn't imagine how hard it is for someone to be going through what you are and not have family as part of your close support network. You seem like a very strong person, especially with all things considered, and I don't think anyone can blame you for feeling these feelings. In the middle of a pandemic and nationwide protests, all you can do is your best, and to me from an outside perspective it sounds like you're doing your very best. We're all human, you included, and your feelings are valid.",

I have a Civil Eng. degree so I worked in the field for 3 years after graduation. I had 4 different jobs in that time span. Each job and work environment progressively got worse (for different reasons). I eventually had to quit the field and get out of it. I wasn't sleeping, I was dreading my work week to the point where it made my weekends and week nights unenjoyable, etc.. I have felt significantly better after getting out of that field.\n\nAnother change I've made is deleting Facebook and Instagram. That one helped a lot too.",

I am trying to look into rental properties so that I can be my own boss (for the most part). Maybe you should look into some means of passive income so that you don't have to work as much for someone else/contribute to greed/the system.",
    "I have tried therapy and medications, and neither has worked out well for me in the past.  I\u2019m going to give therapy another go, I think.  I actually think that is the answer for me, just have to make time.  And in the past after therapy sessions I\u2019ve been no good for working.  It\u2019s just not an easy thing to do.\n\nI\u2019m in accounting and I\u2019ve been doing it a long time.  I\u2019ve been in my current job for almost 10 years and I am paid well, so it\u2019s a very big decision.  My job clearly makes me unhappy on many levels, but I always decide it would be best to keep it and try to make changes like medication to make it more tolerable.  And of course that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBack to your original post - I got an audit request today and I just about had a mental breakdown.  I\u2019m working on it now, but I have to convince myself most days that I can keep going.  In some ways I think I am pretty strong, because I do what I do, and I don\u2019t think my co workers have to deal what what I deal with.",
    "I'm trying to earn an income from my passion. I'm a Twitch streamer but it's not going very well. I've wanted to do it since I was in my late teens. I'm now 42. \n\nStreaming services didn't even exist when I had the idea to show myself gaming. I got NBN last year (it's the fastest internet available to residential areas here) so I started streaming within a couple of days of it being activated. At first I did it every spare moment I had but I got burnt out. So now I only do two scheduled nights a week for a couple of hours each night. \nI'm not really a talkative person so I don't say much. But I love it. Last night I forgot I was even streaming I was enjoying myself so much. But I don't think I'll ever get to the point of being able to earn an income from it.\nI've worked out I'd need a minimum of 10,000 viewers per stream to be able to make as much as I do from my job.\nBut that many people watching would be overwhelming. I wouldn't be able to handle it.\nIf I could stream for eight hours a day maybe I'd have more success. But with a full time job I'm limited to two hours a night. On the weekends I can do it longer.

    "Of course it\u2019s not good for spreading awareness. The show is meant to be entertaining, the producers don\u2019t actually care about \u201cthe cause\u201d. They just want the show to be successful and make them money.",
    "i think they did everything wrong. i absolutely hated the broom scene, it made me cry a lot afterwards because i just don\u2019t understand why they felt the need to show that? like what was the purpose? it\u2019s a nasty, stupid show.",
    "It's utter shit. BoJack Horseman did an amazing job of mental health issues. I also really enjoyed Crazy Ex Girlfriend's portrayal of mental health but it's not perfect or for everyone but if you enjoy it, it's worth watching the full way through.",
    "Yeah fuck that show, two times",
    "The fact that they show the suicide on screen, and fairly graphically based on the original edit, is disturbing and sickening to me. I tried to watch the show to form my own opinion and just couldn't get through it. If you commit suicide, even if you leave notes behind, you wilL NEVER see how they will respond. Them glorifying this \"teaching them a lesson\" idea is harmful and disgusting.",
    "I agree I watched a YouTube video from a woman name Kati Morton who\u2019s a licensed therapist who broached on the topic of 13 reasons why and why she felt like it was a bad show and one point that I thought she made very well was that shows often times tend to romanticize suicide like it\u2019s a beautiful thing when in actuality it\u2019s awful and nothing about it is good I think shows like this are giving young people the wrong idea because what this show is promoting is not only the romantic aspect but also anger and revenge the need to get back at others who hurt us instead of acting taking an more productive manner and teaching others about awareness overall I think they could have taken this shown in another direction",
    "medical professionals agree with you. some actually said the things did in this show were things they told the crew not to do when they were consulted.\n\nif you're suicidal or depressed, don't watch that show. it does everything wrong in terms of avoiding triggering a MI episode.",
    "I started watching 13RW but didn't finish the first season. However, I read the book. As far as I know, they completely changed Hannah's suicide scene so it would be more shocking, and although they removed (did they?) that part after all the controversy it caused, I think they should have been more careful in the first place. Suicide is a sensitive topic and not everyone can write about it. We need to stop romanticising suicide and mental health issues and TV-series shouldn't portray them as something glamorous. They are not, and these scenes don't help, they can be triggering.",
    "I worked at a mental health clinic and a client watched this and it triggered more anxiety attacks, flashbacks, thoughts of harming herself and I\u2019m not sure on all the exacts but it was the OPPOSITE of helpful. I\u2019ve had a problem with this movie ever since, never read the book but haven\u2019t wanted to.",
    "It was universally condemned by medical professionals. It's actually why the show was cancelled because it lead to a spike in teen suicide attempts.\n\nhttps://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(19)30288-6/fulltext",
    "I hated how they made her suicide like a revenge plot against the people who wronged her. It also made her suicide to be this thing that can be easily explained by bad life events. Bad trauma isn't the only cause of suicide. It is also combined with mental illness and a severe chemical imbalance in the brain. Like it never really felt like I was watching someone who was depressed. Also in the second season clay keeps seeing her and talking to her, and it made it seem like she wasn't really gone. But suicide ends everything, you dont get to see the aftermath. Also what they did with Tyler was fucking terriable. He almost shoots up a dance. But clay runs in front of him and talks him out of it and the friend group decides to watch over him at all times instead of turning him into the police.",
    "This show came out during a time I was suicidal, dealing with my anxiety disorder, and battling severe depression. I was having panic attacks everyday. I knew that it showed a suicide and I refused to watch it because a lot of my anxiety revolved around me having suicidal thoughts. Everyday at school people would talk about it and it triggered a panic attack every time. FUCK this show.",
    "I was 16 when it came out and I watched the whole thing in one sitting. I was completely out of touch with reality after that. I started planning my death and become obsessed with \u201cleaving a message\u201d behind for those who had hurt me. even though I\u2019m constantly dissociated now I\u2019ve never felt out of touch to that extent",
    "The show was horrid. They went against what clinical psychiatrists said. it took them 2 years to remove the suicide scene but they kept in liek 4 r*** scenes...",
    "I personally was disturbed by it as it was focused and aimed at youth, who make such impulsive decisions already, due to lack of maturity.\n\nExamples of unhappy situations leading to a the taking of one's life is irresponsible and teaches NOTHING.\n\nBetter that they show the successes of how time and support and maturity will solve most of these teenage angst issues.",
    "I hated it, I watched it while i was not in the best place and i truly hated the way it romanticises suicide and drops everything on the fault side. Also heard about the second season: put every 'hot' or highly debated topic and mix it together to get views, that's not how you make series, and I'm sure that's not how you spread awareness.",
    "I\u2019ve lost almost everyone I\u2019ve ever loved or been friends with. Various causes but the hardest are the suicides because you\u2019re left wondering if there was anything you could have done different to stop them and help them feel better. \n\nThe worst one for me was the very first boy I ever dated. We were no older than like 11 when we went on our first date. Obviously we broke up and went on with life but we always remained extremely close friends. Even in adulthood and even though e we really only got to talk every so many months. \n\nA week before my birthday he had invited me and my significant other at the time, out to this cabin he bought with his wife for a weekend trip. Which would coincide with my birthday and we had a really great weekend planned. He had just finished making a huge batch of mead.\n\nThe day before the trip another friend called me to gently let me know he had shot himself in the early morning hours. No one wanted to tell me because everyone knows the amount of loss I\u2019ve endured throughout my life. Scared I would snap I guess. Not gonna lie. The last time I had cried or felt anything upon the news of the death of a loved one was easily years prior. You get numb to it when it happens all the time. \n\nWith him? It was immediately like someone punched me in the solar plexus. The air was literally knocked out of me. I also knew exactly how it went down before I was told. This guy was a pretty wild dude. Tons of energy and a total adrenaline junkie. When I was told he short himself the first thing I asked was:\n\nHow many bullets did they find in the chamber?\n\nNo one knew until days later but I was correct in my thinking. There was only one bullet in total. None were left in the chamber. He was playing Roulette. We could never figure out what prompted him to do it or how many times he pulled the trigger. Did he just keep pulling until it was over? Or was it an accident on the first try? \n\nAnyway my point is I had started watching this show before realizing what it was and upon realizing what it was I got physically sick to my stomach. It\u2019s almost as if they are kind of glorifying the act. \n\nI\u2019m not against ending ones own life in regards to incurable and debilitating disease. I\u2019m all for the end of life act, I watched my mother die slowly and in agonizing pain literally begging the nurses to overdose her towards the last few months. I do find it beyond tragic when the young feel like they have no other recourse than to end their own lives.",
    "That show was special to me due to (in hindsight, unlrelated) personal circumstances around the release of the first season. Now that I'm over those circumstances, I've started seeing the show for what it really is.\n\nIt's not a romance drama. It's not a teenage love story. It's a really slippery slope that you have to have a REALLY open mindset before watching. Anything else and you're definitely gonna get the wrong message from it. And no, the warning they added isn't enough to deal with the fact that the show's basically an advertisement for suicide.\n\nIt's a really serious story that people HAVE to have an open mind to be watching.",
    "This show was critiqued heavily when it came out and still is. It completely breaks media guidelines for representing suicide\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[http://www.suicide.org/media-guidelines-for-suicide.html](http://www.suicide.org/media-guidelines-for-suicide.html)",
    "It assumes the most frustrating question: \"why?\"\n\n\"Why?\" is not a helpful question. \"Why?\" presumes someone has fault. \"Why?\" presumes understanding of your negative feelings. \"Why?\" presumes that there is something to fix.",
    "I can agree to this",
    "I agree. It shows suicide like a way out.",
    "[deleted]",
    "preaching to the choir",
    "Not to mention sodomy of a minor. The show is awful.",
    "I couldn\u2019t agree more, my mum started watching it for some reason and I can\u2019t even be in the same room as the tv when she\u2019s watching it it\u2019s just so disgusting. Ugh it just makes me feel like shit yknow? You don\u2019t need to have a reason to be suicidal some people just are and it\u2019s a shame but  unfortunately that\u2019s how the world works",
    "Actually correlated with increasing suicide rates.",
    "Im happy other people realize this too, because somebody can actually hurt themselves. I might be too dramatic, but if somebody with suicidal thoughts or depression watches this, you never know.",
    "I remember when it aired there was a lot of controversy around it. I never watched it but my girlfriend did and was telling me about how awful it could be. Prompted me to make this: [https://youtu.be/qbOWGl--m0I](https://youtu.be/qbOWGl--m0I) , as I was watching A Series of Unfortunate Events at the time and thought the song was fitting. \"Ask any stable person should I watch and they will say 'look away, look away!\"",
    "Not to mention that for about 1 week after the show was released suicide rates got higher. Mental health professionals on the set advised against adding in certain scenes but the producers did it anyway, and they only took them out after these statistics became more well known.",
    "My sister was really suicidal when she watched that show, the warnings never helped and I had to talk her out of suicide. I think it\u2019s an abomination to the mental health community and shouldn\u2019t even be up. I hate that show to it\u2019s core.",
    "My therapist told me straight up not to watch it.",
    "It was horrific.\n\nThe book was great, the girl was NOT painted in a good light, it was a story where she may have been pushed over the edge due to others, but she put blame onto many, some that was very justified and others less so.\n\nJust know, I havent read the book for 7 years now, but the little I saw from the show and the subsequent reviews- it ROMANTICIZED SUICIDE.\n\nLook, if you are put into a situation such as her, you are generally not at fault whatsoever. But you cannot expect others to act for you. You are responsible for yourself, if you are unwilling to act for yourself, fight for yourself, then you can't expect others to do so.\n\nThe show should have done this: 1 prequel, where she was alive. Then her subsequent death. Afterwords they should have never shown her again: That is what death is. One second a live, breathing human with millions of memories- the next they are gone, no redo's. They are gone. \n\nSure, it is more difficult to make a compelling narrative- but writing isn't easy, and the final product should not be one that is so god damn harmful and shows the complete opposite of what the message should be.",
    "The suicide rate increased so much, that\u2019s actually very sad. Especially since the whole producers and actors said they are spreading awareness but they just worsened the problem.\nI wonder if they even feel any guilt about it",
    "I liked the first season. Thought they lessened the effect of the harsh reality by making more. I didn't feel like they were trying to make suicide beautiful. But it definitely did nothing to raise awareness",
    "What about Euphoria?",
    "[Yep.](https://youtu.be/tfzx86mp83Q)",
    "I think the only \"good\" thing that the show did was to get people to start talking about mental illness and suicide. Although I do not think it was in the right way, I know that the show helped break down some of the awkwardness or taboo toward suicide. I 10000% agree that the show was crap and portrayed depression and suicide in the completely wrong way.",
    "My little sister was maybe 14/15 when she started watching it at my house. She had heard about it from her friends, it was trendy thing to watch among them at the time. Being 12 years older than her I have sort of a weird mix between a traditional sibling relationship and a parent-ish or aunt-ish type relationship with my sister I guess? I of course am the responsible person when she's at my house but I don't want her to feel like i'm parenting her or babysitting her or anything like that now that she's a teen. As her sister I just don't want to nag her or anything like that. \n\nBut with this show? I had such a hard time not preaching to her the whole time. I did make a few comments about some of the worst things I noticed, I just couldn't help myself - and thankfully she totally agreed with me and seemed to already take the same opinion as me without me even needing to point it out. Like how the kids seemed to be listening through the tapes in an attempt to figure out whose 'fault' the suicide was and how wrong it is to see suicide as something to blame on any individual. So that made me hopeful that some other teens were able to see through the worst parts of it too. But it was rough to watch and we didn't even get to the \"bath tub scene\" that i've seen referenced online.",
    "Completely agreed.  I have struggled with depression, anxiety and all that goes with it for years.  A friend wanted me to watch with her.  I only made it to episode 4 and about 10 minutes in ... i was aware of the feelings they were portraying that\u2019s for sure.  She bagged me for months to finish watching and I finally had to lay it out for her that I just couldn\u2019t do it.",
    "Book is better",
    "I found that really irresponsible of the producers and everyone involved with promotion - To suggest it was about bringing awareness. Among many other issues the show has when looked at from that point of view It also implies you, the deceased, will get some sort of closure if you leave enough notes (tapes), when in reality very little would come from said letters and regardless you, the deceased, will not know one way or another. Had they not gone the rout of promoting it brining awareness I wouldn\u2019t care one way or another about the show but I think it\u2019s really misleading and damaging, especially to younger people.",
    "Agreed. I watched I think 4 episodes and went into a bad depressive mood. I stopped watching it just cause it made everything worse.",
    "Thankfully never watched this show. Heard all these reviews and how complicated the message was. I think people don't get the message though. After this show was released it changed a lot of views on mental health, generated conversation in a young generation.",
    "1000% agree and has since the first season came out",
    "Same thoughts as you. \n\nFor people who are already suffering from depression, this show may have just shoved them to doing something devastating. Giving them the idea of committing suicide (ie. how Hannah died) as a form of escaping the pain, and a meaning for them to do so (to incite regrets and guilt amongst people who may have directly/indirectly led them to their eventual decision). \n\nTerrible for people who are already suffering from mental health issues in general. \n\nI would rather have a show where it shows how a person recovers from depression instead.",
    "It's just a dumb drama for people to gawk at",
    "I completely agree with this. The show makes suicide out to be \u201cthe ultimate revenge,\u201d when in reality, continuing to thrive and live your life despite the shitty hand that\u2019s been dealt to you, is way better revenge than taking the easy way out. I know this first hand.",
    "Agreed. The more I watch Netflix the more I'm beginning to feel disgusted at their nonexistent ethical compass. I'm not saying we should promote censorship at all, but some stuff should at least be labeled with more warnings that the content is wrongfully portrayed. (Calling the kettle black but it's better than nothing). Like, tiger king is super fascinating, but feels lousy to earn so many bucks on human derrangement, the horrible show of gyneth paltrow is NOT scientific at all, there are usually lots of factual errors in netflix documentaries etc etc.",
    "This is why I\u2019ve never watched it",
    "I fully agree. Also, the show lacks subtlety because so many people in it suffer from all these extreme things that happen to them. Like you cant be depressed without getting bullied, abused or raped.",
    "That show came out forever ago are people still talking about it. If not Why bother",
    "I watched s1 with good mental health and it made me very unsettled and I stopped.\n\nInsatiable also postures about dealing with overweight teen issues when it\u2019s just mindless entertainment for profit.\n\nNetflix shows stop having false pretenses of altruism and just admit to being a form of passing time when its 10pm on a weeknight",
    "I 100% agree with you.",
    "Honestly though, it feels like that shows was romanticizing suicide",
    "As a teen, before the show aired, I was in a bad place. I had thoughts of suicide but I didn\u2019t really wanted it to end. I just wanted to get back at those who hurt me and denied their part in my misery. A massive \u00ab\u00a0fuck you it\u2019s your fault, hope you suffer guilt for the rest of your life now\u00a0\u00bb. And even as a teen I could tell that was a stupid idea. So when the show aired and people claimed \u00ab\u00a0awareness\u00a0\u00bb I was pretty pissed. They talk about suicide but not how to get help...",
    "no shit",

    "It's just a show. Fictional.\n\nThere are books writren even in the past more gruesome than this.",
    "I like the show. Regarded of what you think. The show has gotten you talking about it and the messages it is sending and ultimately that is getting people talking about mental health which is a good thing.",
    "They really shouldn\u2019t be promoting it as something to \u201craise awareness\u201d and \u201cspread the message\u201d. The way they\u2019re selling it as some sort of suicide awareness thing is sickening.",
    "They're not that good at entertainment though.",
    "Any attention is good attention...",
    "right! they took out Hannah\u2019s suicide scene, I feel like they show take out the broom scene with Tyler and Monty as well",
    "I really thought Bojack did a great job at explaining what it\u2019s like to be depressed like repetitive terrible thoughts that we loop over and over again in our heads. And the lousy things we do to people who are trying to help us.",
    "Crazy Ex is so dang good. It's probably worth mentioning that I'm also super into musicals so perhaps I'm biased, lol. But that show really helped me through some stuff. They really manage to handle mental health in a respectful and realistic manner while STILL making a fun and entertaining show.",
    "Bojack Horseman\u2019s ending was amazing. The whole final season was. \n\nRunaways had some good takes on anxiety and medication, too, in the second season.",
    "I didnt watch the show but of course just happened to walk into the room while my roommates were watching that scene.  I immediately ran to my room and had a break down.  Ive never been triggered like that before.  I wouldnt even say that I was even ever *that* close to ending it, but a lot of my childhood consisted of me in a depressive and suicidal state.  That scene brought all those memories back.  I cant imagine how many other people it must have triggered.",

    "Exactly! There isn't always a why",
    "I wondered this when I watched the first two seasons. If I had seen this when I was 16, I definitely would've found it romanticized what Hannah did and the whole leaving this super long message after my own death and living on forever through it",
    "Yeah it\u2019s just virtue signaling. They know that the show will be controversial and so they hide behind the narrative that they are promoting awareness and help for people in need. When in reality their only goal is to have a successful Netflix series.",

    "Exactly, even if they claim they are trying to support awareness, the scene isn't needed. And including it implies that they don't understand triggering",
    "What's wrong with her?",

I\u2019ve done extensive studying in the psychological, physiological, and even philosophical effects of exercise with relation to mental health. I strongly suggest reading the book \u201cSpark\u201d by Dr. John J. Ratey. If it doesn\u2019t work for you, it doesn\u2019t work for you.

    "But I do truly wish you nothing but the best. I have never seen/heard anybody saying that exercise is THE answer to mental illness, otherwise professional bodybuilders & athletes would be immune to mental illness, and that is just not the case. Exercise is merely a piece of the puzzle, and I believe is a necessary piece for many people through personal experience helping myself & helping many others. There truly is a connection between the mind & body. Where I am not yet a mental health professional, I am in school to become one. I would be more than happy to help you find a therapist/psychologist/psychiatrists in your area that suits your needs if you would like.",

My MIL says just go for a walk like it\u2019s magic and I\u2019m like that\u2019s not quite how it works but thanks. \n\nI do think people should try and find what works for them.

    "There are many types of depression and mental illnesses. Some people think they have depression when they only have a temporary shock and therefore they say that exercise or eating healthy cures depression.\n\nI suffer major depression since my teens and exercise or diet do nothing at all for my mood and mind but both help for my health and feeling of well being. I walk 3-6 hours a day because it's all I can do in order to leave home and not to shoot in my head and it helps me much to feel better and not to get much worse as I got during the criminal lockdown for 2 months making me much more sick and crazy and even fat.\n\nI say, do what you feel like. I for instance eat an awful diet with a huge ice cream per day, a whole 1 liter of the most sugary flavors, plus one big bag of chips, fried corn, very bad junk food and it helps me a lot to feel good. Depresi\u00f3n anxiety insomnia panic disorder are just hell on earth for traumatized losers. It won't go away with exercise or anything, medications make it much worse and doctors know absolutely nothing about it, they lie pretending to know but they don't.",

Just let them out for a walk. That's hyperbole btw. \n\nI encourage you to keep studying then. Going for a walk is a pretty good response to a variety of stressors, including negative thoughts and emotions caused by mental illness. \n\nBut that advice hasn't worked for so many people since forever that my initial response is on behalf of all those whose daily torments will not be improved by going for a walk. You're welcome to look up my instagram (same name) if you'd like a direct contradictory anecdote to your claims, and see that I am but one of many. \n\nSo please don't just throw \"just go for a walk\" as all encompassing advice.",
    "Well thank you for the follow up. You do have to understand this advice gets posted -a lot- to places like /r/mentalhealth, and associated subreddits where the readers may tend to skew towards more serious mental health issues. And it can be annoying, even as it comes from a place of good faith. Especially coming from a psychiatrist.\n\nBut you're shouting into a void of people this advice hasn't worked for. Without the follow up you provided, it's easy to assume your advice is just another throwaway line from someone who can't empathize with people in this subreddit.\n\nSo since I do still agree with the initial assertion that going for a walk -can- help (not all, but maybe more than less), I'd actually like to bother you to make a new topic and share your expertise. \n\nCite sources, relevant quotes, studies, and tests performed. Create a post with irrefutable evidence of the benefits of going for a walk. While it may not apply to everyone, there are enough depressed people here with the resistance to the idea of ever getting better, and reading a post that challenges their core ideals on the subject may be enough to get them up and walking, which might not help, but is a first step towards positive changes they can make.\n\nCause trust me. This post gets posted every single day, multiple times a day, and is met with the same skepticism and criticism. This is your chance to make a difference. \n\nNot for me, but for the people that can be helped.",

If you are interested I can link you books, articles, or presentations I have made on the topic. If it doesn\u2019t work for you, then it doesn\u2019t work for you, and I am sorry.

And at sunset, I would \u201creturn to my prison\u201d as I approached my house at the end of the walk. It helped me to give my \u201cprison time\u201d meaning and spice I guess. I started committing real time to learning the electric guitar I bought 6 months ago, I got more interested and motivated in my school work , I got into playing COD warzone with friends so I didn\u2019t feel lonely.

It took being an ocean away in a 6hr time difference from home to finally feel free. It was actually about 5 weeks in that I realized my boyfriend back home was abusive and at the time he was my only escape from my even more abusive family. The last two weeks abroad I fell so hard from the fear of having to go back and face it all after feeling so free.

Quarantine has nothing on it. And if you're not mentally prepared for the shift in reality, you're going to get very depressed very quickly. \n\nSo it's a nice fantasy when things get bad. But if you really want things to get and stay better, start building the reality you want with healthy boundaries and standards right where you are.",

    "I've done that, kind of. \n\nI lived in Chicago in my 20s, and had a good group of friends there, nice apartment, got comfortable. But I changed a lot during my time there, and my friendships didn't make me feel good anymore. I kind of realized I had been living to \"keep up with the Joneses\" and therefore my friendships just didn't have the substance I wanted. I also realized I had forgotten about my two big goals: to travel, and eventually to save enough money to buy land someplace cheap and live a simple life. So I saved up and left for a 14 month international trip, and never moved back to Chicago. I kind of used the distance and the trip to end the last few friendships that still lingered. \n\nThough you can physically move away from people and situations, they still exist in your mind. I still feel hurt over the best friend that dumped me for superficial reasons. And I still feel bad for intentionally \"losing touch\" with some friends. And I'm still working on improving the insecurities that led to me having shitty friendships to begin with. However the space definitely gave me room to grow and change.  I emotionally matured, learned to communicate better & more honestly, and learned to allow myself to be the imperfect-but-trying human that I am. I learned how I wanted to connect with people (more authenticity, supportive, understanding), and the friendships I've made since then are so much deeper - albeit few in number. I don't have friends that make me feel bad about who I am, and I also know not to allow that dynamic in my life anymore. \n\nI'm still very much figuring it out. I think if I learned some of these things, I could have improved my situation in Chicago without essentially ghosting people. I could have had honest, compassionate conversations, and allowed my friends' reactions to determine if we could evolve together as friends or part our own ways. But there's no use speculating and I'm at peace with how it all turned out.",

Social media accounts, websites, high school diplomas - the list goes on and on. So be careful what you wish for!\n\nHowever I do connect with the rest of your fantasy. Sometimes I feel like it would be fun to start completely afresh. Making a living as a writer is hard and sometimes I do wish I could just try something different. A bit of escapism is nice, but I prefer to deal with the here and now, even if at times it's kind of difficult.",

It's what I give myself in order to reset and just not think at all. In the future though, I'd like to go away for a bit of a longer period. It's not that my family and friends are bad and I want to run away but more so of \"I'm tired, I need a break, imma just go\". Or even when I'm reallyyyy old I'd just live off the edge of the country with money I've saved up.",
    "Sure. But the catch will be that you will in fact have to create a new you. If you're just running from a problem/s that will only follow you, your location won't have much effect. \n\nSo if you move to a new place only to continue being a servant/doormat for the new friends...that's a lot of work in the wrong places.\n\nBetter to just work on yourself and stop being such a pushover.

The upside is that it makes life less boring, the downside is that there aren't any people in your life that remain a constant so whenever you move you start again at 0 and it does take a good 2 years to fully establish meaningful friendships and relationships.\n\nAlso people who aren't used to moving a lot and who grew up in a certain area are used to their home and will miss it by default, even if the new place is objectively better.

Im currently going through seasonal Depression or to be more specific, im having personal anger against the fact, that im supposed to work from 8am to 5pm, mon-fri... then i need to get to work and from work home, do household, do Hygiene, eat. So in the end its not much time per day that i have for myself and especially things that bring me joy (hobbies).

You can guess where this is going towards already; so one day not long ago, the initial thought hit me unexpected during daydreaming: i will not accept all this without at least a compromise, so i decided to take my \"Me-Time\" by force and just do whatever i really want until im really tired and able to accept going to sleep. \nMy final thought on this: its darkest before the dawn; and since i noticed how understanding and beautifully quiet the night is, i try to hold Back the day as much/often as possible.  The price i pay is only a bit of my concentration due to shortened sleep. Luckily my job is not really hard and i have Methods(mentally) to get through my shift with a sort of ease, so its worth it.

    "When im feeling bad, anxious, or uneasy sleep is my go to. I forgot to set an alarm and woke up 5 minutes after my exam ended just a few days ago. I was so devastated that all i could do was sleep despite being very hungry and literally just waking up from a 7+ hour sleep.",
    "I do this too. Sleeping is like death-with-benefits: death-like state, but no commitment!",

    "Usually it\u2019s something with work. I always find something to worry about. It\u2019ll just eat at me, and make me scared having to wake up because then I know I have to face it. I guess maybe I hope that something will happen to keep me from having to wake up and deal with it. So I force myself to stay up because I\u2019m worrying so much about the next day.

    "Exactly..... But you know...... Gotta find the silver lining in everything. ;)",
    "Yeah usually every night. I\u2019ve tried to say I\u2019ll go to bed at like, 11:00 but either I\u2019m just too anxious about the next day, or sometimes it\u2019s even guilt that I wasn\u2019t productive enough during the time I\u2019ve been home",

    "Every step you taken in the direction of self care is a good one! I know how hard it can be to do basic hygienic things, but really no matter how small the step you take it's a good one. \n\n\nSomething else that helps is just *starting* something, break what you want to do into the smallest steps possible to get the momentum building up.\nFor example - if you wanted to go to the gym and work out, the first step would just be change into your gym clothes, that usually sparks your motivation enough to get you to at least go to the gym, then once you're there you might as well do something or else you just wasted all that time travelling.\n\n\nAnother example - basic hygiene, just walk into the bathroom with no expectation that you have to do the daunting task of washing your face or brushing your teeth, stand at your sink and look in the mirror, notice your toothbrush sitting on the counter now in reach, is it worth the effort now? Maybe...? Hm sure why not. Then wow, your mouth feels clean and so do your teeth, might as well wash my face now too, I like this feeling!",
    "As someone who spent years not brushing his teeth due to depression and other conditions\n\nPlease try brush your teeth as a priority. \n\nI ended up with months of agony from rotting teeth (waiting times in UK NHS dentists) then went on private and spent thousands of pounds a lot of money. That was a few years ago and this year I'm back at it due to issues from before still. \n\nNow I use Sensodyne Novamin, Gingigel (basically magic) Listerine, & floss religiously.",

    "I\u2019m in the same boat. I\u2019ve always just been kind of apathetic to hygiene and cleanliness. I somewhat make it work like a normal adult when I\u2019m dating but other than that I can let it go for a while. I hate being filthy though and love being clean and like when things are clean. I just don\u2019t care ENOUGH to do anything about it in most circumstances. Anyway, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling good about things. That\u2019s awesome.",
    "I too washed my face for the first time in probably months yesterday and the day before that as well. And while I normally only take a shower once a week I at least considered taking another one yesterday. Who knows, maybe tomorrow I'll even clean my apartment a bit? Not today though lol",
    "All I did was read the title and fuck yeah I\u2019m legit so proud of you!! I know how hard the smallest things can be. Inspired. Ima do something today too now.",

    "This may be equally gross but I\u2019m inspired by your bravery lol. I very carefully scrape my teeth clean with my fingernails every day while I\u2019m watching TV and then drink water, swish it all around. I\u2019ve been doing this for seven years and I don\u2019t have a single cavity or recurring bad breath, and I never have to worry about spending my limited energy on tooth brushing. I make sure to get regular dentist checkups because it feels insane that I could do that and have it be effective, but so far I\u2019ve had no complaints. They don\u2019t even tell me to floss! Idk, might help next time things are getting out of hand :) sorry if too gross lol.",

This meme helps me on my rough days. \n\nAnother thing that helps me is checklists. (Get out of bed. Shower. Brush teeth. Get dressed. Deodorant. Take meds. Take dog out. Feed dog. Eat.) If I do absolutely nothing else thay day, thats still 9 things I've checked off. For people with mental health issues, all of those things are friggin achievements, deserving of a ribbon and confetti. \n\nGold star, friend! I'm proud of you.",

    "I thought I was the only one. When I have a weekend off, I don't do anything. It's hard for me to even get out of bed let alone worry about basic hygiene. Only keep it up when i have to work but some days it's hard for me to make sure I shower. I think I showered yesterday but I'm not really sure. I legit forget when I showered last. It might be 4 days, now mind you I worked everyone of those days outside. Teeth brushing is the only thing I keep up on when I work. Make sure I do it every morning. \n\nYou have inspired me to try more. I have tried but I usually just say meh. This post will make me try to motivate myself to do more.",
    "Hey guys, I\u2019d say I struggle with mental illness/poor health but for me, bodily hygiene has never faltered or wavered. I am very meticulous and particular about brushing my teeth 2-4 times a day (I don\u2019t like residual taste from meals/coffee) and showering 1-2 times a day (once to start my day and then a rinse after a workout). For people who find it difficult to do these things because of mental illness, what is it like? What makes it difficult?",
    "There is just no energy to do it. No motivation. A lot of procrastination.",
    "In my case I just feel like staying in bed or somewhere comfortable and not do anything at all. Or even if I was doing something get it over with even quit and go back to drowning my self in my thoughts to escape reality. Things like personal hygiene feel extra like they get in the way of me trying to...... Do nothing",
    "For me it starts as just not having the motivation to shower or brush my teeth right then and thinking \u201cI\u2019ll just go do it in a little while\u201d or \u201cI can put off showering until tomorrow\u201d, but then after a while I start feeling anxious at the thought of doing it, because I know I should\u2019ve already and I feel gross and bad about myself. Which makes me want to do it even less. It\u2019s a vicious cycle that\u2019s hard to break",
    "Being \"low functioning\" makes it difficult. I would say that my experience and many others who would be deemed \"low functioning\" have trouble doing basic tasks like personal hygiene. It's hard because you know you feel gross, and you know you have to do it. I would explain it as: it's as hard for me to have the motivation and the willpower to get out of bed and walk 5 ft to the bathroom and brush my teeth as it is for a person not suffering in this way to have the motivation and the willpower to go on a 3-mile run. It just feels absolutely draining.",
    "The analogy of spoons is helpful. There are only so many spoons in the drawer, the number is different for individual folks (based on a bunch of other factors), and to make certain foods will take a different type and number of spoons. When you\u2019re out, you can\u2019t cook anymore until you replenish your spoon supply (aka, rest). Ever try to stir a pot of chili with a teaspoon? Not recommended XD So, we have to be judicious with tasks, because running out of spoons in the middle of the day could lead to you not having dinner, or not being able to pick up a buddy from work on time. Like do I really want to go brush my teeth if it means I deplete my spoons and don\u2019t get anything done for two hours after that? No, no I do not. I have a lot of triggers around hygiene (particularly showering) that make it take extra spoons, and I rarely have it in the budget. So to speak. \n\n\nTL;DR: limited resources equals limited output.",

Couldn\u2019t have been done without him by my side. :) We make it a point to be co- existent rather than co- dependent but it\u2019s extremely reassuring knowing I can depend on him when times do get rough. \ud83d\ude07\ud83d\udc96",

I guess I never thought to call him my partner because we\u2019re both still in our early 20\u2019s and our relationship has just began blooming (in terms of length of time together, our relationship has always been flourishing) but with the definition you stated, we are most definitely partners! I still run into difficulties with sharing my emotions but I\u2019ve gotten a lot better just because he unintentionally leads by example. He just recently relocated to his seasonal job so I won\u2019t be able to do many activities with him until after this summer, but I will no doubt make a goal list for us.

I manage to brush them at night but in the morning I wake up with such dread and lethargy that I start to just watch YouTube in an attempt to numb myself. Getting a routine is such a help and I am trying. I have found that doing something in the morning I really don't want to do opens the rest of the day up a little bit. It all seems like a hopeless uphill battle but I have been well in the past. It's annoying that you forget how it feels to be functional.",

    "I'd like to be able to do that, really I would. I just.. can't. I know it's necessary and I know I need to be doing it. I used to try so hard and I'd lock myself in the bathroom until I had panic attacks and threw up. Putting the brush in my mouth would make me start sobbing and hyperventilating, it got so bad that I couldn't walk past the bathroom without getting nauseous or crying. I spent an entire year trying to work through it, my parents even tried behavioral therapy but all that accomplished was I'd get physically sick the day before the appointment and have debilitating stress migraines.\n\nIt feels like I'm making excuses and a lot of people have told me I gave up on the therapy too soon. I've been told a million times that if I just tried a little harder or been less stubborn then I wouldn't have this problem. Every single dentist I've seen has tried to drill scary facts into my head about how I'm ruining my future. I know all the risks and the consequences, all that does is stress me out and get panic attacks thinking about how I can't brush my teeth without getting panic attacks! \n\nIt doesn't help that none of their dire predictions have come true. I learn from cause and effect and so far nothing bad has happened. Every time I go to the dentist I ask them how much it looks like I brush my teeth. Every single one says something around afew times a week. I haven't touched a brush in almost 6 years and yet everything looks fine. I know you're probably thinking that's disgusting or unbelievable but other than flossing maybe like once a week, I haven't taken care of my teeth in years.\n\nI keep telling everyone that once something bad happens I'll listen to them but honestly I'm sure if I could do it even if my teeth were falling out. My parents pretty much gave up on making me when they found out that all those times I told them I brushed my teeth I only wet the brush and put a bit of toothpaste in my mouth so it'd smell like I did it. It seems so childish looking back, but I know I'd still be doing the same thing if they hadn't given up.\n\nI know this probably wasn't what you were referring to and it's likely I'm talking about a completely separate problem, but I figured I'd post this anyway and see if anyone else has gone through through the same thing.\n\n[I would like to explicitly state that I am by no means trying to say that its not necessary to brush your teeth, or that you'll be fine if you don't do it!!! I know I probably got something coming to me and I'm gonna have to accept the consequences of my actions probably sooner than later, so yeah. Ok I feel better now that I've said that.]",

NO. But when it comes to getting out of bed in the morning it pretty much takes an act of congress. If it's the weekend and I have nothing to do I don't get out of bed until after noon.

Now I live in another country with a national health insurance that doesn't cover dental. I have so many cavities but I'm trying not to make them get worse but I still go without brushing accidentally at night or when I don't have enough time in the morning. Flossing is extremely hard to do especially with overcrowded teeth (which ironically makes flossing more necessary. Even with those floss picks, it's hard to get myself to floss, but I need to). Getting fillings, crowns, and root canals are so expensive and not even permanent solutions. I hate that teeth are luxury bones and I hate that they decay so easily. One of my teeth have started hurting when I chew. It's minor but I know that's a sign that one of my cavities have started to get worse and I will possibly need an emergency root canal.

For sure, this is a difficult topic, but many churches (Catholic, most mainstream Protestant, etc.) they have grown in their understanding of why people do it, and that we need to trust in the love and mercy of God. As He will know what was on their heart.\n\nNot to get all preachy, but I\u2019ve done a lot of reading on the theological understanding of suicide because of some people who did commit suicide that I knew.",

    "I feel like some people aren\u2019t really comfortable with sharing exactly how someone died especially if the details would make people uncomfortable, but at the same time I don\u2019t think essentially lying like they are is the answer. \n\nYour aunt and uncle might not want people to know the real reason why your cousin died which sucks but I suppose they have their reasons for it and will think people will judge them badly if they knew what happened.",
    "First off, I am so sorry for your loss. The business of living can be so challenging and sometimes suicide feels like our only option. I really appreciate you naming it - suicide - and actively making your efforts to stop the perpetuation of stigma that comes from even discussing the topic. To be honest, that usually comes from fear and lack of understanding. I by no means excuse the behavior of your friends parents, but when I read your post, I think about their reluctance to share this based on their fear. Maybe the fact that they would have to look at themselves as a potential contributor to the death of their daughter. And that is scary. Maybe one day they will be able do some self-reflection and place this into their awareness and maybe they won\u2019t, but what\u2019s clear to me is they are not ready to face their own possible  deficits and inequities. \n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well in this all.",

    "wow, I\u2019m so fucking sorry. that is absolutely horrendous that your cousin\u2019s parents would do that. all you did was posted her on a memorial site with a link to NAMI and a suicide hotline and they forced you to take it down? my only guess to why that might be is because they don\u2019t wanna be the people who made their own daughter to commit suicide, so they decide to ignore it so they don\u2019t have to come to the realization of what they\u2019ve done. I mean, I can imagine if my own child committed suicide I honesty wouldn\u2019t wanna acknowledge it because it means I was such a horrible person that they rather commit suicide then be with me. even then, it\u2019s still wrong to ignore it and try to please god by hiding their suicide. god knows everything and he knows what they\u2019ve done wrong. I\u2019m so sorry that happened and I hope you and your family recover from this horrible traumatic experience. I am so sorry and hopefully your cousin\u2019s parents realize what they have done wrong and come back to their sense. sending love from the usa \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

    "Hey there internet stranger!  I truly am sorry for your loss, though I know it doesn't make it hurt less.  That said, I completely and utterly understand where you are coming from and for you, giving this information on your cousin's memorial site helps you cope because hopefully you can prevent someone else from committing suicide.  \n\nYou mentioned that they felt or came across as feeling ashamed of her.  Some families regardless of their religious beliefs feel shame when a loved one takes their own life.  It's quite common.  The question is why?  I think it has a lot to do with the general idea of \"I should have seen this coming\" or maybe they truly do feel culpable.  Really unless a person asks how another feels, we never truly know.  The parents are grieving in their own way, and maybe they haven't come to terms with the suicide part yet.  For some, suicide is still a personal and private struggle and they don't want it in the light, it is a difficult topic for sure.  \n\nMaybe for them it is more them wanting to cope with this idea of suicide of their loved one in private because they aren't ready to face it.  \n\nI don't want you to feel like I'm taking sides or that your feelings aren't valid.  You are allowed to feel your feelings and they are real and present.  I'm doin g a poor job of it, but I guess I'm trying to say that maybe they do blame themselves for what happened.  Every person copes differently, and maybe right now it's too raw for them but in the future they may feel open to that conversation.  \n\nIf I could offer a suggestion, maybe in time you could educate them on your struggles so they can better understand what their daughter was going through.  \n\nI'm here if you want to talk.",
    "That's okay. **They may try to hide it, but God knows the truth**. I'm dealing with a suicide in the family too as of recently and feeling honestly really guilty about it, but ~~drugging myself~~ into numbness which can't even come close to fixing anything. We were outright about the fact that it was a suicide, though, but I'm kinda surprised. My family is either the type to do what yours did or to be really loud about it, and start pointing fingers and I'm surprised we handled it as well as we did, this time. Sorry, that was totally unnecessary, but I'm just trying to say, I know how unfair it feels and have dealt with stuff like this, too.\n\nAlso, you don't go to hell for suicide. You go to hell for being unsaved, because every single human being can no longer live without sinning; that time has passed, hence Jesus. Yes, suicide is a sin, but if you've already confessed that you are a sinning human and accepted Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, then you will go to Heaven.",

    "Her parents ARE embarrassed and ashamed. It has nothing to do with God and her \u201csin\u201d, they are embarrassed and ashamed of themselves. They simply don\u2019t want anyone to know the truth because then the people around them may start to question and subsequently and possibly see that they\u2019re not who they pretend to be and could\u2019ve helped their daughter more. This is not to say that they are at fault in anyway, but they don\u2019t seem honest and people of character. I simply cannot imagine how heartbreaking it is to lose a child to suicide, but I would like to imagine that I would feel obligated to share my daughter\u2019s life and memory to possibly help someone else. Hopefully as they grieve and time goes on they realize that her death could be the catalyst to saving someone else\u2019s life. \nI\u2019m so very sorry for your loss. Maybe you can share her picture on social media with a link to NAMI? Maybe a poem or quote that doesn\u2019t use the term suicide, but people could figure it out. What about posting a fundraiser in her honor that would donate proceeds to a mental health/suicide charity? You could simply say \u201cIn honor of my cousin who left this world much too soon\u201d? There\u2019s so many ways to honor her and bring attention to the reality of suicide, without being blunt and direct. \nOr you could say fuck it and do and say what you want! \nMy condolences to you.",

    "Narcissistic \"parenting\"101...it's all about \"Outward Appearances\" with these animals hence the not mentioning the cause of death at her memorial/removing your post about the cause of her death in public as it would reflect badly ON THEM even though they lost a child it's irrelevant in their sick minds. She could of gone on to be a Noble prize winner and that still wouldn't of been enough in their eye's. THEY CAN NEVER BE PLEASED. Every child has \"place\" in this vile cult, my own sounds very similar to your late cousin. (The Scapegoat) so they can unload their inner filth onto the child. Then you have the \"Golden  child\" you know? the one that can do no wrong and MUST be revered at all times?. Then depending on the size of the \"Cult\" there maybe a \"lost child\" who's just basically invisible in the cult and often labeled \"a little bit slow\" or some other sick tag to dismiss their relevance UNTIL the Scapegoat has enough and either does something drastic to escape like your dear cousin or they go \"no contact\" then they will \"dump\" that roll onto the lost child.\n\nAs terrible as it sounds she is in a far better place than she left due to the unbearable pressure of being brought up by these demonic scumbags can do to your mental health and I speak from 47 years of experience dealing with them myself and wish I had of had the information available then that I have now...How I am still here is nothing short of miraculous. I'm sure your cousin has now found the peace she wasn't allowed by her \"parents\".\n\n\\*On a final note I would urge anyone experiencing this type of pressure from their \"Parents\" TO GET OUT and GO NO CONTACT as soon as you possibly can or I promise they will either put you in an early grave or in my own case destroy your life.\\*",

None of her loved ones really thought this was happening, and now they all wish they could have been there to do something about it. \n\nProbably, she gave everyone who actually loves her a vicious case of PTSD where they will play the scene over and over in their minds and have fantasies about what they could have done, and now it's too late. \n\nMeanwhile, religious people know you go to hell for killing yourself. \n\nSo, you want them to focus on all of that shit? \n\nPeople want it to just go away. \n\nIn addition, once someone commits suicide in a family, it tends to spread like a disease, and more suicides happen. So, I'll bet she has relatives that feel like killing themselves right now.\n\nYou need to think more about the issue.",

But in this situation, respecting the family's wishes is a: disrespectful to the deceased, b: actually dangerous as it contributes to a stigma that leads to far too many preventable deaths.\n\nDon't let anyone convince you it's right to keep quiet because her family wants you not to mention it. In the days and weeks to come (and possibly further) try to remind yourself of that. This isn't about respecting her family's wishes.

    "Agree. If you're tired you don't wanna do certain things. But it's a boomer mentality that you must do do do and be productive all the time or else you're lazy.",
    "There is a book called Laziness Does Not Exist by Devon Price that shows these ideas",
    "Some of these comments seem to be misunderstanding you, saying there's a difference between someone genuinely lazy and someone who's struggling and that just completely misses you're point since those \"genuinely lazy\" people they talk about DO NOT EXIST. Lazy on the weekends after you've worked? I think you mean to say you're tired and burnt out from working all week. There's always a REASON behind what we perceive as laziness but there isn't a single person on earth who genuinely wants to fail or not do the things they have to or were told to do. The idea behind laziness is that someone who is lazy is choosing not to do something purposefully and without reason other than it's part of their personality but like you've said, it's depression, anxiety, executive dysfunction, or something else. When there is a reason behind it then it isn't laziness and there is ALWAYS reason behind it, whether anyone is aware of the reason or not.",
    "I grew up believing that I was lazy and feeling bad about it. Now that I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety I can recognise that it\u2019s just my body telling me I need a break. I sometimes still need to remind myself of this but find it helpful to say to myself that I am choosing to rest or choosing to take a shortcut (e.g. ordering food delivery instead of cooking) so I can recover my strength.",
    "I agree to some extent but when you look at most other animals they spend so much time sitting around doing nothing, they aren\u2019t being lazy though they\u2019re just conserving energy for when they need it.",
    "I\u2019m glad you have come to this conclusion because yes, you are right. Laziness is just a word to put other people down and make them feel like shit for not being productive every waking second of the day.",
    "I've always been called lazy but people don't understand that I really struggle to do things that I don't wanna do/ find interesting. I have not been diagnosed with ADD but I've always wondered if I have it. I just really relate to this post.\n\nI score very low for conscientiousness on personality tests so there's that as well. Some studies show that people with trauma, mental illness, or adverse childhood, are more likely to develop these 'undesirable' traits (low conscientiousness etc), so that's important to keep in mind, and that aligns with your line of thinking.",
    "So my counter to this is that there absolutely is. I am gonna make dinner right now. I could do something that takes 2-ish hours and needs me doing a few prep things or I could do what I intend to do which is make noodles. This is based entirely in laziness. It's not about time efficency because if I could I would order home delivery pizza or something which would take like 1 hour and also cost money. I just wanna put in as little effort as possible for any result. This is laziness. To be motivated exclusively by mimimal effort even when the desired result would be different is the core of laziness. \n\nI think the better question is whether or not it is inherently bad and the answer to that is of course, no it's not. It's a morally ambiguous trait that can lead to bad results. Bad being harmful in this context. It can lead to neutral results and even good results.",

    "Woah weird I just had a convo with my therapist about that this morning. She helped me realize that the main reason I put off important meetings and phone calls if because of my extreme social anxiety and not just me \u201cbeing lazy\u201d. It\u2019s truly a fascinating thought since our western culture today is basically structured around this notion of \u201clazy\u201d vs \u201csuccessful\u201d \u2026. Tsk",
    "Yes! this is coming up more and more and I'm so glad to see it. lt's a hard concept for many people to accept though. Anytime you try to explain to people how lazy is just a slang insult and not a real human quality they assume you're making excuses for undesirable behavior.",
    "Yes!! As an anxious person, I often struggled with the idea of being \u201clazy\u201d because I would always beat myself up for not doing lots of things at once. It was only when I started really taking therapy seriously that my therapist advised me to take some time after our sessions to truly relax and be kind to myself (watch a nice tv show, have a nice lunch etc). I was a very burnt out college student dealing with heaps of past trauma I hadn\u2019t even gotten through yet as well as all sorts of family drama. Of course I was anxious and depressed! Of course I wasn\u2019t ever going to feel great when I wouldn\u2019t let myself have a break from that! So, I took her advice and relaxed more and now I\u2019m actually proud to be what some would consider \u201clazy\u201d. I need this time for me and that\u2019s really no one else\u2019s business",
    "I couldn't agree more.\n\nLittle things like this are why I believe everyone should be taught basic psychology. The more I learned, the more I realized there's so many variables out there determining human behaviour. \n\nWe don't have free will (IMO) - ALL of our actions have an influence behind them, whether we believe we consciously made a decision or not, there are things out of our control that persuaded said decision. \n\nCommon sense isn't real - every single human being has a different experience in life. Yeah the grass is green but a large part of the population are colour blind, or blind, so to THEM it's not the same green everyone else sees. It's still green, but the brain is processing it differently. \n\nNot everyone has the same motivations, capabilities. Some people are motivated by money, some people aren't. Someone in the r/canadahousing subreddit discussing high rent for student housing, literally said to me \"well, I managed to work 3 jobs while going to school!!\" yeah? i took 6 years to finish high school because i was self harming, couldn't get out of bed, didn't see a future. working 2 jobs at a time almost broke me.",
    "Definitely. In China where I live people are educated that hard-working is a virtue while laziness is a shame but no one is pointing out the unreasonable. Imagine being a kid with difficulties concentrating/reading or a person with somatization of depression, and being called lazy.

I'd never call a person lazy, not after what I've been through and seen.\n\nSomeone might call me lazy. At this point I'll force them to either keep their mouths shut, or to actually give a helping hand. Which nobody ever does as it's now words over actual help. That to me cries laziness. Like a moral laziness in all honesty.",

    "My thought exactly",
    "I would say there\u2019s such thing as laziness, but only in an acute sense. If you\u2019re a \u201cchronically lazy person\u201d it\u2019s definitely one of the things you listed.",
    "I completely agree. There are many factors that contribute to what is perceived as laziness, but much of it is best understood as mental or physical health problems.",
    "100% I\u2019m the queen of living things to last minute, I left myself 8 modules to do for resits at my final year of uni and of course I was so overwhelmed by it I did nothing at all. I didn\u2019t do that because I would rather stay in bed and eat snacks all day (I mean kinda but not the point) I couldn\u2019t do my work because I was no overwhelmed In my own depression and anxiety that whenever I would open my laptop I found my mind would just not work and on days where I was in bed for over 20 hours it wasn\u2019t because I wanted to be there it was because I had no mental energy to physically move",
    "I consider myself lazy but it is probably just part of me being super depressed. There just isnt any motivation to do anything, no desire to improve or grow. As much as I wish I could function as a person I cant force myself into constantly do do do when it just exhausts me without any feeling of satisfaction or gratification. I dont wanna struggle just to survive long enough to struggle more.\n\nSo yeah, I am lazy but my choices are essentially being lazy or just ending myself to get off this ride.",
    "I can\u2019t clean my room but I average 9k steps a day and attend spin class 4 times a week. \ud83d\ude10",
    "So, there might also be a different reasoning. For this, I first need to connect laziness to responsible behavior. Lets say that someone is lazy is when one perceives his or her own responsibilities towards the other but handles those responsibilities only in a flawed manner such so that the the he or she perceives that he or she has dealt responsibly, but the other person does not perceive that he or she has dealt responsibly WHICH he or she could have known if he or she listened to the other person.\n\nWhen you define laziness like this, it becomes harder to weaponize laziness as a means to attack or gaslight people. Why? Let's look at the Boomer example. When Boomers call someone lazy, they don't realize that they have more responsibilities towards the younger generations than the younger generations have to them. Boomers had more chances, more means, but also more errors made for which they have to make up. Contrary, Boomers also had moments of responsibility in which they dealt fully responsibly. These generational differences can lead Boomers to think that they have played there part well enough and that they can relax now. This cause Boomers to let partly go of their responsibilities and only act to such an extent on them to satisfy with the moral satisfaction that comes with the perception you have dealt responsibly. But this differences between having dealt truly responsibly and partially reasonably while thinking you have dealt truly responsibly is lazy if Boomers heard the outcry of younger generations but didn't act on it.\n\nI am inclined to maintain the word laziness due to its moral meaning and to use it to call out people who think they have it 'done correctly' when they haven't and could have known. But there might be a better word than laziness to cover this concept",
    "Lazy has a negative connotation (dictionary definition: unwilling to work or use energy) as well as passing judgment over someone\u2019s actions. But we never know what trauma/coping mechanisms are behind another person\u2019s behaviour. Or someone may choose to not sign up for the do do do culture and favour more embodied or tranquil time.",
    "I 100% agree with this!",
    "Yes!!!! You\u2019re getting it!",
    "I certainly call myself lazy, for better or worse, but I think there is a lot to be said about jumping to the conclusion of \u201clazy\u201d as a default for someone when they don\u2019t do what we want/expect them to do. \n\nI think we often just use the term lazy when discussing anyone that differs from our work/life expectations. Didn\u2019t work 80 hours? Lazy! Didn\u2019t get five jobs to make it in life? Lazy! \n\nSo yea you\u2019re onto something. It\u2019s silly.",
    "I will put off 15-30 min of doing something I want or need to do at the house because I know I\u2019ll be interrupted while doing that task. So I\u2019ll either never do the task or ill get so little done that I didn\u2019t make much of an impact. So the anxiety that is going on knowing ill be interrupted actually makes me want to do the task less. So now I\u2019ve got abunch of partially finished projects I gave up on for the fear of being interrupted. And yes. Exhausted all the time.",

But it doesn\u2019t make the behavior any different or less negative (coming from a person with terrible adhd paralysis and \u201claziness\u201d)",
    "I very strongly disagree with this. There are many many lazy people around in the world. My father, for example, expects my mother to do everything for him. Now, sure, you might want to argue that him unwilling to even pick up a fork and knife that are 2m away from him and expecting my mother to do it is some of dysfunction or depression but no. He's just a lazy asshole who expects everything done for him. Or when they go working in vineyard and he expects her to do all the work so he can sleep.\n\nI honestly find this attitude that there are no lazy people to be very toxic and letting assholes get away with doing minimum that's required of them if anything at all and then defend themselves that they probably have undiagnosed issues so they're just going to do nothing while others work on them.\n\nThis is just defending toxic behaviors, nothing else.\n\nOr those colleagues who don't care how much it inconveniences anyone but do bare minimum they have to and often ask others to do their job even though they have the least work load. \n\nNo, OP, there are most definitely lazy people and they shouldn't be treated like the victims of they make the life of everyone around them miserable.",

The motivation of doing something that will rewarded later is developed when you\u2019re older and neurotypical so it\u2019s very hard for kids an teenagers being able to motivate themselves for something that won\u2019t be rewarded right now. And of course kids can\u2019t really comprehend the impact on the live. I mean who didn\u2019t want to drop out of school as a kid?",
    "I agree. This feels like another attempt to let people shrink accountability. \"I'm not lazy, J just probably have something undiagnosed, so you do all my work for me.\"",
    "OP didn\u2019t make this theory up. The idea of laziness not being a thing is a common and known sentiment.\n\nI see what you wrote about your father. I can\u2019t speak on that man\u2019s life. But let\u2019s define laziness as people neglecting their personal responsibilities and being worse off for it. Healthy people don\u2019t watch their lives crumble and do nothing about it. Like if someone isn\u2019t grooming themselves, not doing their homework and sit around all day, doing the bare minimum to live, that\u2019s indicative of some underlying problem. People don\u2019t just watch their lives fall to shit for nothing",
    "Yes, you\u2019re right, I\u2019m making up things. Fuck research and science. Who needs it when you can tell conspiracy theories. Yes, maybe I\u2019m really a piece of garbage that\u2019s worthless and don\u2019t deserve to live and tries to find excuses, but I assure you that even if this wouldn\u2019t be a thing in my case, it\u2019s in most cases of \u201clazy\u201d people. So educate yourself before being harmful to neurodivergent people",
    "So true!",
    "Lazy is what we call people who aren\u2019t active. And we deem it a personal failure. But there\u2019s typically a reason for someone\u2019s inaction.",
    "Why is hustle culture bad? Like of course you shouldn't feel bad if you're not working and being productive every single moment, but I'd respect if that's what Ur tryna do",
    "I don't think it should exist because there's no such thing as what the word implies.",
    "I was unable to support myself. I couldn't work, I was eligible for disability support payments but the process for that was excruciating and takes forever. Honestly, I was just really \"lucky\" that I had a partner and family who could do all the physical and financial stuff. My partner paid for everything (thankfully his job paid enough to do this, but it was VERY tight), and family helped with getting housework done and looking after my kids when I couldn't. But even then it wasn't enough. There were weeks where no washing would be done, bed sheets hadn't been changed for months, dirty dishes piled high for a week. It was truly awful.",
    "I\u2019m doing a trial of Thesis, a nootropic supplement, and so far I *do* see some functional changes in my ability to motivate. That said, it\u2019s still early days, and maybe I just WANT to be convinced, or my work lately \u201cfits me better\u201d or whatever\u2026 \n\nIf you have other diagnoses (depression/anxiety are pretty common co-factors with ADHD), you may want to focus on addressing those first, or finding a cooperative mix of meds that helps both. I was able to kill my anxiety pretty well on Wellbutrin, and depression with ketamine therapy. Now that I\u2019m focusing almost entirely on adhd, it\u2019s much easier to address - even COACHING has shown some promise (though it\u2019s a bit like therapy, you have to have a RIGHT coach for you, and I have had no luck there).",
    "Honestly I think I agree. I'm ~16 right now(I realize my og comment might've made me sound older so I apologize if that's the case), and I did develop a much stronger sense of \"gotta get things done\" than when I was around 8-11, which is what I was referring to in my og comment. I still procrastinated but also held my schoolwork to greater importance. (Though I guess it could be as simple as taking High School more seriously than Middle School).\n\nBut lately I got more lazy and started just doing the bare minimum for the most part. And I think it could be due to mental health issues. While I don't think I have depression, I'm definitely very nihilistic which makes it hard to feel motivation for things like that.",
    "> At this stage the brain needs to be rewarded immediately\n\nYeah, no. That\u2019s when you\u2019re like five. [This is a study](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo4WF3cSd9Q) done on kids about instant gratification that has been replicated many times. Even some kids this age understand the concept and can wait. To claim that older kids and *teenagers* can\u2019t understand delayed gratification is just completely false.",
    "Many kids can hold out with reward until later, there's been tests done on this topic and patience can be taught. Also, no one I knew wanted to \"drop out\", we wanted to have long holidays but that was maybe until 15 when people chose their own school and realosed the consequences of lack of education. No one I knew past 15 wanted to drop out. People mature much faster than you give them credit for.",
    "To be fair, even if it *is* something undiagnosed, just because something isn\u2019t your fault doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t your responsibility.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re a minor and your parents refuse to get help for you (therapy, psychiatrist, etc). But if you\u2019re a grown adult like \u201cYou say I\u2019m lazy, I think it\u2019s just undiagnosed ADHD\u201d. Okay. Then do something to counteract that, because that\u2019s really not anyone else\u2019s problem.",
    "I'm not harmful to neurovergent people by saying that toxic behaviours shouldn't be tolerated. They should be resolved. And stop putting words in my mouth just to make me look bad, I don't know you, I'm not calling you garbage. But you don't get to ignore abusive behaviors and turn abusers into victims just because you are anxious or depressed.\n\nI struggle with both, my therapist thinks I'm on the spectrum and I would never inconvenience people just because I don't feel like doing something and either expect others to do it for me or not have it done at all. That's very detrimental in both personal life and work life.",
    "You\u2019re totally missing what they\u2019re saying. They aren\u2019t saying \u201cYou\u2019re not mentally ill/neurodivergent, you\u2019re just lazy and should die\u201d. They literally never said that.\n\nThey\u2019re saying that it may not be your fault, but it is your responsibility. As someone with depression, it can be hard to get up and do shit. Some days it feels impossible. But telling other people that it\u2019s not my fault **therefore they can\u2019t hold me accountable** is shitty and toxic.",
    "I agree. It's not the best analogy but the pressure of always feeling like you could be doing more can be exhausting. Gotta let yourself breathe sometimes.",
    "Are you saying that humans never behave in an interest to minimise the personal effort they'd have to put in? Are you really gonna argue that nothing  person can do is ever just motivated by the desire to just not have to do something? Cause I can personally disprove the claim, well as much as one can disprove a claim such as this one.\n\nThe other day I had the option to cook chicken and rice but decided not to because I didn't wanna put the work into it so I made noodles instead. This had nothing to do with time efficency because I'd have ordered take out delivery if I had been able to afford it as the time, I wasn't low energy or tired and I would have prefered chicken with rice over noodles so it wasn't my tastes in that moment. It also wasn't hunger, due to several factors I don't feel hunger the same way most people do and not nearly as often, I won't go into why cause that's kinda personal. I'm just covering bases. What is the reason I did this? What kind of behaviour did I partake in?\n\nDo mind that laziness is morally ambiguous and that languge is descriptive not prescriptive. Most every word we use is a simplification of a concept or idea. It's primarily a social utility matter before anything else.",
    "Horrible",
    "You don\u2019t suffer from those symptoms. Happy birthday. Other people do so stop being disrespectful and belittle it",
    "No that\u2019s not what they said. Of course it\u2019s your own responsibility to get better with therapy and/or meds, if you want to. They said it\u2019s used as an excuse. Knowing your issues and naming it is not an excuse it\u2019s exactly the opposite. You can only work on yourself when you know what\u2019s wrong.",
    "How nice that you're curious. Here it goes:\n\nIn my opinion and experience, humans automatically always do what gains the most pleasure (either short term or long term) and what gives the least suffers (short term or long term) \n\nThat's all.\n\nTo say it's lazy, is to disrespect someone's needs. Cause at a certain time in history, you were what you did, and this abusive view on people is what created the word lazy. And I don't support that.",
    "What made it unbearable was those people (except for my husband) trying to blame me for my illness and repeatedly telling me that I wasn't \"good enough.\" That phrase damaged me so much - I'm only just healing from it now, but I had to cut them out of my life inorder to start the healing process.",
    "You are completely ignoring my points and experience because they don't favour your conclusions. Maybe your research was affected by cognitive bias as well as you accepting only people who agree with you.",
    "So you have then failed to aduquately justify the removal of the word and not only that, you hold to words having essential meaning.\n\nSee, I didn't describe an act that would provide me with the most pleasure for the least suffers. I don't consider the act of putting in effort into something as inherently bad. Perhaps this is the isssue, you hold to inherent meaning to words beyond the social utility of them where I do not. The way we use language today is queer compared to 200 years ago. Queer as in weird or strange, which was the meaning of the word queer about 200 years ago. Just to illustrate that words do not hold inherent meaning.\n\nEdit: To clarify, I enjoy cooking. I took the route that would take the LEAST effort for inferior pleasure. I am acting in oposition to the idea that you present. Further, if we look at the social utility of the word lazy, there is no innate negativity to the word. Words are not prescriptive they are descriptive and they describe what we decide them to do. We can move away from the idea of lazy being inherently bad without having to remove the word itself because the social utiliy of a word that holds the meaning: \"I did the thing that would reqiure the least amount of effort to get any result I could get even though it may be lacking compared to what an optimal end result would be\". We can just keep the word lazy and shift away from ascribing some inherent negativity to laziness. Just let laziness in itself be morally ambiguous and let the quantifiable harm done by said laziness be the factor which dictates the morality of it.",
    "Because they are YOUR experiences. They have nothing to do with others. Just because you don\u2019t experience it it doesn\u2019t mean no one does",
    "I'm not saying no one does, feel free to point out where I did. I'm saying that there are lazy people and this idea of \"they probably have something\" is simply excusing toxic behaviors, not solving them. They're adults, they're able to seek help or communicate when they're tired but abusive behaviors shouldn't be victomised or excused with this. This idea is not only wrong but only gives defense to people who just don't want to do more than bare minimum to keep doing nothing.",
    "I agree with you. I'm surprised at the amount of people in this thread saying laziness isn't bad. Ignoring responsibilities by taking an excessive amount of \"breaks\" (i.e. choosing to sit on the couch and watch Netflix when there are dirty dishes in the sink) is bad and strengthens depression. They're *still choices* that you make and depression does not make it impossible for you to tend to your well-being and responsibilities. It makes it harder, but it does not make it impossible. You can't pin the blame on your mental health all the time, especially when the people in your life rely on you to care for yourself.",

    "Nevertheless you should see a therapist to prevent falling into a hole again. After so many years theres is probably a lot to unpack there. \nIm from germany and 30 year olds as well. I had similar problems with depression in 2011 as well. If it werent for my parents supporting me time and time again, I would have come close to homelessness as well. Therapy helped a lot with it.

    "Im not usually one to leave myself vulnerable by exposing my innter turnoil. But ig its time for me to tell someone. Im early 20s, and ive had a fairly shit life. I was abused for as long as i can remember,  both mentally and physically. Both to extremes that have caused me to develop ptsd at a rather young age. My mother sheltered me, which caused me to develop attachment issues. With two opposite extremes tearing me into different directions, i have always been conflicted about how to properly understand my emotions, breaking my psyche in two, metaphorically. I basically have to argue with myself to come to any sort of conclusion. My dad was in jail 75% of my life. And when he was out, he was cheating on my mother very blatantly, and terrorizing my family. And then my mother was diagnosed with cancer. She made it roughly 3 years, before she had to get an operation on her intertines, which was done very poorly. It ended up breaking the stitches, which caused it to get infected. After that, she couldnt be saved. So i was forced to make a choice. Allow her to suffer until the end, or sign the papers Nd let her go peacefully. Ive never forgiven myself for signing that paper. I hold myself entirely responsible for my mothers death. And i also found out around that time i also have bpd. Ive been fighting my toxic side forever, trying to unlearn everything i was raised on, but those toxic traits have saved me on many occasions,  so i find it hard to figure out what about me is good, and what is not. I am a human paradox, constantly going against myself. Im miserable, i disgust myself physically, i havent had a real relationship my entire life, my emotions are like geysers waiting to explode from the pressure bottled up, im suicidal as hell,  only managing to fight it back so i dont leave all of my pain on ny siblings. I cant do much without becoming frustrated and sometimes belligerent. The only emotion i can properly process is anger. All the time. Nothing but anger. I desperately want to love and be loved, but ive never been in a position to deserve either. I cant do anything right. Im a waste of space and time. I havent functionally done anything with my life. I dont drive, no family of my own. Im basically just floating around in a world i never belonged in. So im just trying to push my siblings to a point where my selfishness wont break their spirit. I want them to get all they deserve and more, so i can take on my karmah silently and never have to face them with my shame again. Sorry to whoever reads this. Ik its long and kinda convoluted. But im basically just a broken man. With an even more broken heart. And nothing to show that ive been alive. An invisible monster, only there to show you what not to become. An illustration of failure at its most concentrated",

    "I liked a girl and the day we both mutually confessed our feelings the lockdown happened, months of online texting, no direction what to do how will things plan out, many times it felt it will never work out because I was always kinda less affected by things and she would then give me lecture on basic communication between two people and how important things should not be said on a fucking text lol, it always kinda did work out, we knew each others boundaries, we liked to see each other happy. She sneaked out of her house ( which is around 40 kms away from here) to meet me on my birthday in October, noone had ever done anything so good for me tbh. It was all very intoxicating for a few months when some red flags started to show, I gave her  space,  good communication, even put efforts during my end term exams to make sure things go well, and they did, we went on a couple more dates, both of them were some of the better times I've shared with another person, after the second date, she dumps me ,on text, suddenly saying she doesn't see a future.\n\nI just said okay, lmk if you change your mind and block her from my life to help myself get over easily, i was jobless, obese, and apparently lonely too now.\n\n4 months later, I got myself an above average job I could never think I would, lost around 10 kgs, 10 more to go to reach my best physique, went through a phase where my family was in severe atrocity due to covid.\n\nIn these 4 months she did send a few texts, sober and drunk, I replied politely and didn't respond if I didn't want to. A few days ago she asked to fix things but when I said no she told me she just wants to give me a chance to tell her how I felt and talk to her. I was appalled, she just was not the nice self aware and compassionate girl she used to be, now she sounds like an immature and entitled child.\n\nI still think about her, even though everything else in my life is turning for the better and I have not let this incident affect my life in any way ( did go on a tinder date, enjoyed myself but not willing to invest my time in dating rn) , but it sure affected me. I think about her over lonely cigarettes, sleepless nights, and from someone so uptight like me this poetic expression is debilitating, but that is  just how I feel.\n\nI have few friends but I think I'm too embarrassed to toot this horn of sadness again and again lol, and with the job, life is really stressed and I think I am lonely enough to express myself on reddit so yeah.",
    "I really appreciate the sentiment, kind words, and offer to reach out. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but am genuinely curious - what if you\u2019re someone who constantly fucks up in near catastrophic ways? What if someone who has the best intentions consistently makes the most stupid mistakes, despite knowing better or having the opportunities, resources and a support network to be better? What if you\u2019re that toxic friend who cares very deeply about the people around you, but still manages to to cause harm, make their lives more difficult, or disappoint them by not showing up for them as much as they have for you because of your instability? What if you don\u2019t deserve what you have and feel guilty asking for more? It\u2019s hard to move forward when you\u2019ve burned every bridge, hard to heal when you\u2019re still hurting and causing harm, hard to find self-worth when you truly are a burden on your loved ones and know you\u2019re holding them back.

But the thing about my hobbies is that my self esteem practically killed itself so it's hard for me to draw anything, and I have writer's block, so I can't really write anything at the moment. I might try and convince my mum to let me buy an electric guitar so I can learn how to play, so that might be a good distraction. Thanks for the advice.",

    "People look to me for answers and sometimes I do have what they're looking for from my past experiences but the truth is I'm not much better mentally than the people I help. I struggle to but I found that spreading love when I can helps everyone including me so this is what I do in my free time. Mental illness is a bitch and will always be but you gotta learn to love yourself and show it that you arnt gonna let it control you anymore.",
    "Yeah supposedly everyone's always emotionally abused me according to some people who I've talked to but I guess I'm pretty used to it so I think it's normal. It taught me to count on no one but myself and it helps a lot being happy with being alone because I know im the only person that can and will always have my back. It's good you're good at your job even with the anxiety I get social anxiety so I can't imagine have to do sales.",
    "I like to share my story because I know that you can get better. A few months ago I was at my lowest, suicide notes, drug addiction and not talking to anyone. I'm not happy yet but I've never been more motivated to better myself and now I can look at life and tell myself that it'll be okay and for the first time ever I don't see an end soon. If you focus on what you want and yourself I promise you it can get better I am not done yet but I was able to get on the right track. Sure some nights I still feel depressed but atleast now I'm sober and do plan on staying alive for awhile longer. I promise you it gets better you just have to want it and go get it :)",
    "I used to hate people who told me I can be better and I can work hard to be happier but recently I've started to realize that they weren't wrong I was. I doubted myself for years and told myself I wouldn't be anything but now I know I'll be what I want and I'll be proud of myself if I keep working hard. Rain is necessary for the flowers to grow. Some people don't believe me when i say this and I wouldn't have believed myself a few months ago. Whether you want to believe it or not I just hope you try and work hard to be proud of yourself.",

I've been playing a lot of guitar if you ever want message me I'll teach you what I know, I mainly only play acoustic though. I wanna buy some drums soon and get better at those cause I used to be good at them.",

And let's be honest your improved life isn't that great probably, you most likely don't make a lot of money. I was born in ex soviet country shit childhood and then had my chance in a 1st world country but fucked it up by not studying because I was too busy trying to get peace in an household were my mother and step father were always arguing. I have no motivation to do things I don't even enjoy things I used to I just do it so I don't sit in an empty room all day. I can't keep a job because I get bored of it in less than a week, I never got paid for a full week cause I never lasted that long. In general I just have no feelings towards anyone and it annoys me to pretend to care about people like I've tried soant times to make friends like online but I just get bored of talking to them and just block them after like 2 weeks. This is annoying me but I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself (ironic right), just too much thoughts in my head rn and I get tired of listening to them all",
    "That's really not how human beings work. You can't say that high value humans aren't needed more than worthless ones. I care about a lot of people, I do NOT need them.

You can be broke and happy as long as you really try to look for the happiness.",
    "This is where we see different I think. You see value towards society I see value towards morals. Sure people like Elon musk have more value in society but he also has good morals and that what's truly makes him a valuable person. All these people who have a ton of value in society but don't care if they hurt the people at the bottom truly have no value in life.",

I don't have any, I have nothing i don't want to do anything, I have no goals I don't even know what my goal could be and I only feel better when I spend money on things I like and since I quit my job it's been much harder to deal with. I have no motivation to work either I just can't do it, I try but it pisses me off that I will live to work these shit jobs were no one cares if you died today because you're so replaceable in the world.",

    "Yeah even when you don't owe it to the anybody, spreading love is always important even if it's just small compliments to strangers.",
    "You're replaceable in society, not the world. This world is different with you in it even if you feel insignificant. Society doesn't give a fuck about you but the world and people do. And I was in the same situation, I had to set goals for myself and now I'm working to meet them. For example, I'm now going to the gym and I'm trying to be able to be proud of my body and I'm trying to learn drums/guitar and I'm trying to get good with them. Goals won't just come along you have to set them yourself and have to do something that will make you happy and proud of yourself.",

At the moment, I'm not flourishing. I still feel resilient, but if it's managed to knock me down a peg, so I feel it almost certainly affecting everyone.\n\nI can't shake the feeling that we're going to be mental health issues at an unprecedented scale. At the best of times, only one in three people with mental health issues seek help. Right now, I'd fathom it's a lot fewer. In a desperate attempt to find a scalable salve, I put in a grant to help me fund a website to promote the positive mental health benefits of certain video games. I desperately hope it gets approved. If not, I'm probably going to have to sell my car or something to build it myself.",

But now I feel like my old habits have turned back on and see the outbreak as an excuse to become permanently distant again.",

I play 2 instruments (one not very well but I\u2019m learning), and I\u2019m also learning to draw, and since the quarantine I\u2019ve started doing yoga every day with videos from YouTube.  I\u2019ve had back pain for almost a year now because of a slipped disc and the quarantine has finally given me the time to actually do something about it.  \n\nAnother factor for me is that when this started both of my roommates went to stay with other people, so I\u2019ve been home alone too, which is way less stressful for me.  I can make as much noise as I want at whatever times I want, which is nice.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen my fianc\u00e9 in over a week at this point, since someone at my work got covid-19 I\u2019ve been self quarantining and only going to work and home.  I miss him, but it has been interesting to see all the other ways I could spend that time that I was spending with him.  He has his own stuff he\u2019s working on, he plays 4 instruments and he\u2019s started meditating every day with an app, so he\u2019s not too distressed about it either despite him not even leaving home to go to work since he works from home now.  \n\nI don\u2019t think it would be good to have this go on for months or years, but I am kind of enjoying the break from everything.",

I'm close to graduating, but now I've gotta take time off just to catch back up on bills.",

I have been vomiting every morning due to the anxiety, but we are down to one income and we need that to get by. To top it all off, instead of being supportive, people in my life have been mostly distant and my soon to be brother in law even tried to guilt me for \"ignoring\" him and not responding to him even though he hadn't contacted me for a while other than a comment on a picture on Instagram that really didn't warrant any response. People in my apartment building and at the grocery store seem pretty hostile even though I try to respect social distancing and such. I'm just trying to keep it together like everyone else I guess.",

I dont have to stress if I have had a terrible night sleep which happens frequently, as I know I dont have to get up early or have a stressful day ahead of me. \n\nI struggle if my mental health declines and I need distractions outside of my house, but all in all. This has been the best thing for me and I'm actually worried about re adjusting when it goes back to normal.",

    "It mostly depends on the person. But from what's going on around me i would agree. This year has just been a lot of bad news for me and my family so far though. Try going outside if you can, or just sit in front of the window.  Also surround yourself with more upbeat people or people that care about you alot. If not in person by internet. Im not a professional but i hope this helps you.",
    "Mine has def improved. I\u2019m a 30 year old female union factory worker. My job is extremely physical and strenuous, but i NEED it for the money and mostly the health insurance. For 11 years from age 18-29 i didnt have health coverage. I saw a few different therapists through referrals from the free clinic i went to, but it didnt really help. Over that decade i was in college for 2.5 years and ended up just not going back one day and leaving bc everything in my life was too much. I live in a very toxic household and started working at age 14, and tried college so i could not end up like my parents... and in that time i tried at least 5 different SSRIs (anti depressants) but they didnt really ever work.\n\nDuring the year prior to me starting my job at Ford (and having health coverage) I was In a very bad place. A new SSRI seemed like it was helping a little bit possibly, but it caused me to do stuff in my sleep and it was scary. I tried a new one and it made me worse, which is something i had felt the SSRIs had always done, thats why i never took them for long. At about age 22 i started to realize more and more that i knew what was wrong with me mentally, but i didnt have the health coverage to actually find out. \n\nAge 29 my insurance was finally in full swing and i made an appointment with a psychiatrist and was finally properly diagnosed. She said that I have bipolar disorder (what i figured it was for years) and that anti depressants actually make you WAY worse and cause you to \u201crapid cycle\u201d...she is still my psychiatrist and i have also been seeing a therapist. Even though I\u2019m really unhappy at my job i need it for the excellent pay, and free, amazing, health insurance. It\u2019s saved my life.\n\nOn the 13th of March I worked my last shift due to COVID-19. that week i only worked 2 out my 4 shifts bc i was in a bad place mentally that week and i used my two days that i am allowed to use if i need a mental health day. I get two days a month that i can use to stay home if needed through my FMLA (family medical leave act) paperwork. So my check that week was only fir 2 days. Luckily the week before i got my yearly profit sharing check so i had a decent amount of cash at the time...so for the first 3 weeks of not working i had no money worries even though i didnt have any coming in. \n\nDuring the first 3 weeks of being laid off i have been in such a great place mentally. I have been painting, crafting, cleaning, organizing, reading, started a new skin care routine, writing, sleeping well and napping sometimes, cooking for myself and the family ( due to my work hours i can\u2019t due this generally)... i have been in a really great place mentally, and i know it\u2019s bc i have not had to work. However, due to all this i had to blow that money and I\u2019m getting really scared that i will not be able to move into my friends apartment in June when their roommate leaves as planned. Which is something that i REALLY need in order to prosper. Two days after valentines day last year my boyfriend of 3 years that i lived with woke up one morning and dumped me and kicked me out of our apt...three days after being added to my phone contract and getting new phones... and a week after i got in a terrible car accident totaling my 3 month old car and breaking my sternum...he was an asshole i guess, and i had to move back home, and buy a bed and a car... so this past year i have been rebuilding my life. \n\nSo yes, for the first 3 weeks i was in an amazing place mentally, bc i didnt have the stress of my job. Ive already been aware that i feel i only have 5-10 good years of working full time in me. My job is so exhausting and since I\u2019m on an assembly line it\u2019s all mindless, physical work that leave me trapped in my head for 12 hours straight. Plus the hour commute back and forth, i can\u2019t do anything but work, eat, sleep during my work week. I know I\u2019m only 30, but ive been working since i was 13, and have always worked very hard trying to get away from my toxic life. I have already feared that i mentally won\u2019t be able to handle full time for that much longer, and this real segmented that I\u2019m right. That work is too stressful at times for my mental health to be able to get up on time, get myself out of bed, get there on time and do the work. I can go a month without needing a break but if i have a bipolar episode i don\u2019t know when it comes, what to expect, or how long it will stay. I mean, i can be a feminist and know that at the end of the day i need extra care, and if i get married I\u2019m gonna need someone that understands that, and i can hopefully go to working part time only, and somewhere much easier, and that i may actually enjoy. \n\nSo now that my money is gone, and my unemployment still has yet to start coming in, i am starting to get really anxious. Also, i live bear chicago and northwest indiana, so the weather is really changing. When the weather starts getting nice, and i can smell it in the air, and it\u2019s sunny out, i get really really anxious. I don\u2019t know what it is, like reverse seasonal affective or perhaps my body remembering trauma. My first, clear, bipolar depressive phase started at age 22, at this time when the weather was changing for spring. It lasted til October and for the first time i understood how people could end their life. I was no stranger to depression, but this was different. For some reason i knew i would never be the same. Now, bc of that long bipolar episode i get super anxious at even the smell of nice weather. Not always, but it can be bad when it does.\n\nSo, i was in a really good place during this for weeks. The happiest i had been in a VERY VERY long time. But I\u2019m super anxious now....however, i think if my unemployment was coming in i would still be in a great place... i really do hope that you feel better. If you need to talk you can send me a PM, all i have is time... just know that you are not alone. We are a community.",
    "Yea",
    "Mine's always been horrible\n\nIt's still horrible\n\nAm I gonna go into cardiac arrest any minute? Probably.",
    "I feel like my depression has gotten a little better since I am getting to spend more time with my daughter, but on the flip side of that, spending more time with my daughter has my anxiety at full tilt.",
    "Yeah man.  Idk if it just feels easier for some (and is actually jeopardising their recovery) or if it actually benefits some, but my mental health is taking a hit.\n\nUni moved online, now can't keep up with material and assessments, nor can I work sitting in the same place all day in my room, so I just dropped all the subjects (real shame because this was the first in like 4 semesters I was actually making progress and looking to sit some exams), the gym closed so all those goals are kinda fucked - fitness also because I can't really run too regularly because of my feet - and the mental health benefits of doing shit has gone, I don't get outside enough and in general am just flattening quite a bit.\n\nThing is it's not wasted time.  In times where you can't do things, improve, expose yourself to new experiences, maintain some of your hobbies, exercise fully or even work, you can always practice mindfulness - in fact this is the best time to do so.\n\nIt's important just to keep a few good habits going:\n\nBrushing your teeth/ washing daily\n\nEating regularly and focus on nutrition (try to get enough healthy fats, proteins, vitamins, fibre, antioxidants in your day and avoid processed sugars and saturated fats - especially as being in quarantine, these sugars and sat fats just weaken your tolerance to life).  Maybe you can even hit a caloric defecit and lose some fat if you want, although not recommended for weight trainers who want to maintain muscle mass.\n\nExercising - go for a run, do some pushups every 2nd hour, some Turkish getups maybe, single leg squats etc. This really revolutionizes your mindset for days even after one thing (one set of pushups at max reps at the start of the day can make the difference between a good day and a shit one).\n\nOutside - go for a walk or sit in the sun for any amount of time.  This does a similar thing as exercising.\n\nAny discipline - people don't like doing nothing.  We like to think we like doing nothing so that we trick ourselves into being motivated to do things with the promise of respite afterwards, but we only like recovering from hard work, not doing nothing.  For this reason, it is much more beneficial to read stimulating material, learn things in depth or generally improve at things - vegetating on the couch watching netflix or gaming (not all gaming ofc) will just lower your resilience and generally decrease your sense of purpose.\n\nInstead, try to find something you want to do, or have been meaning to do but been putting off, and focus all other energy on that.  Of course if you have just about any solid responsibility in this time, most of your resources will probably will be preoccupied with dealing with that.  If you have few commitments though, finding something productive is a great way to make use of your time.\n\nFor me, I've been meaning to read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Solzhenitsyn for a while - maybe I'll read war and piece.  I've been reading Aurelius, and have been wanting to read up on Epictetus.  Similarly I've been practicing my trumpet improv which needs a lot of work, and bettering my poker game.  I still have a few things to do with uni (study some prerequesites but also just general academic interests) so I've been doing that too.\n\nThese probably won't apply to you, but the point is if I do all of these (in order), it becomes a lot harder to have a bad day.  If I have a bad day, it's normally because I have failed to do one of the things, and really that is just a lack of discipline.",
    "Mine has gotten significantly better!! Because I no longer have to go to work every day and fake a smile 24/7, drain myself verbally and mentally keeping small talk with older clients and coworkers, physically try to walk around like I don\u2019t have a weight on my shoulders nobody can see(my mom is a high functioning suicidal alcoholic with a xanax prescription she abuses, and verbally abuses me though I literally do every thing for her including cooking all of her meals and cleaning her room/the apartment, and is currently living with my bf and I as my dad recently split from her and he no longer is there to keep an eye on her/monitor her drinking and suicidal ideation, and my older brother no longer cares). Simply not having to act like I am happy when I am severely depressed with generalized anxiety(and on medication + doing biofeedback on myself at work), and also deal with work stressors, has been life changing. \n\nI love my job, and at my lowest points it was/is the thing that keeps me going. But the rude parents and lower end spectrum clients I work with can be so hard to work with(keeping that fake smile) 5 days a week with such difficult personal life problems. I was also working overtime on top of this for the last three months(mom moved in 4 months ago), so I don\u2019t get home till about 7:30-8 most nights when I\u2019m at work by 9-9:30 am. Eating dinner that late after I cook it, and it sometimes being my only real meal of the day was just another thing bringing me down. Now I have time to make food and actually enjoy eating it!\n\nThings are hard at home sometimes, but if I isolate myself in my room and avoid my mom at all costs/bite my tongue, things are pretty damn good. I\u2019ve been quarantined along with all of them(we all got over the virus!) for over four weeks and I couldn\u2019t be happier.",
    "Kinda??? On one hand, my relationship with my family is extremely unstable, like one moment you and your dad are good, your stepmom isn't in a bad mood and feels like making her stepchildren suffer with her and your stepbrothers aren't constantly screaming and fighting each other so you don't have to calm things down (or scream at them to stop because your on the last line) because your dad expects you to be the good \"older sister\", next moment, boom, you're all on thin ice. Just making a single noise would lead to everyone screaming at you. And I end up having to take my anger out on literally anything because of being so constantly exhausted. Like my bro just asks where the milk is and I end up being pissed at him for no reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then again, I now have time to write and draw, and that's a good output for all my pent up emotions that I'm not allowed to talk about or show.

    "I LOVE and flourish at both of my jobs and can't wait to get back to them when things settle down, but when things got shut down it felt like a load off my shoulders; a break to catch my breath a bit.

So worrying about how we're going to pay the mortgage or buy groceries is thankfully not something that I worry about. \n\nAt the start I was crazy productive doing things around that house that I have been meaning to do for ages, started a garden, sanded and restained the outdoor furniture, cleaned the garage... so many things. That was Mid-March?\n\nNow, I'm still forcing myself to do things. Cook dinner, clean the house, make the bed, laundry, mow the yard/misc. yard work, all necessary errands (grocery shopping, picking up dog's medications, etc.) but I'm crying at the drop of a hat. I feel so overwhelmed and drowning, but I don't know what I'm drowning in, if that makes sense.\n\nSo, to be honest, I'm not sure how I'm doing. I thought I was doing okay, but now I don't know. I come from a long history of depression and the past few years, after I quit a terrible career and transitioned into a 180\\* opposite career, have been the most stable, happy, and optimistic I've been since I was 14?

I have a job, but my productivity and motivation have plummeted significantly.  \n\nI\u2019m a single guy, living a lone, not able to visit my parents across town because I would hate for them to become ill if I am carrying the virus.  Not being in a relationship, and the prospect of not finding a partner in a bar or coffee shop has this feeling like a really lonely time right now.  \n\nWhen the gym opens, I\u2019ll be able to workout all of my frustrations, but for now, I am struggling.",

My anxiety levels haven\u2019t been so low!\n\nI\u2019m in college - I\u2019m grateful that my classes are online and lectures are recorded, so I can go back and listen to the parts I missed. \n\nJust like u/Saberleaf, I\u2019ve become a lot more positive. I\u2019ve been cooking, baking, spending time in the yard and the house has never been cleaner. \n\nA lot of my friends think I\u2019m weird, but it makes me happy to know I\u2019m not the only one who appreciates sheltering in place.\n\nEdit: typo",
    "I've become far more introverted and my anxiety turned to social anxiety in the past year so I hear ya on my mental health doing a bit better by not feeling like I have to go out and socialize... I love being home with my cat, plants, and crafts <3",
    "same here i feel better bc i don\u2019t have to go to school and be stressed and forced to fake my emotions every day. i still have rough nights, but overall pretty decent",
    "With all due respect I don't think this counts as typical, because you are still able to go to work/make money and in a rural area which drastically decreases your chances of being sick. Plus not going out isn't a change to your desired/normal routine.",
    "Same. I'm the healthiest I've been in years. But I'm sorry to everyone who's suffering right now.",
    "There\u2019s less pressure to do shit with my life rn. Almost everyone\u2019s just at home doing nothing.",
    "I can relate to this. At first, quarantine had been so nice and a lot of weight lifted off my shoulders. I already like isolating but after a month of doing nothing, I\u2019ve started to suffer a bit. I\u2019ve been doing so much of nothing all I do is daydream and overthink and it\u2019s left me in this other world like I\u2019ve lost my mind. \nI think it\u2019s really important to stay busy doing these times and it\u2019s so amazing you\u2019re able to work on a farm. I haven\u2019t done anything since school has ended and it\u2019s hard to even mind motivation to go for a jog or do a painting.",
    "You just explained my day. I live with an abusive as fuck family so school was kinda my escape but I'm now failing everything",
    "You see someone and talk about what sounds like depression.",
    "Sometimes it\u2019s hard to realize, but the feelings/thoughts you may be having don\u2019t necessarily reflect or originate in reality. Sometimes I just feel awful and try to ascribe my feelings to something going on in my life, sending me into a self-loathing, helpless spiral. But it\u2019s not my life that\u2019s making me feel bad, it\u2019s my dumb brain. And when I\u2019m properly medicated, those bad feelings really do just go away for the most part. I hope you can be kind to yourself and find what makes you feel balanced and capable, whatever that may be for you.",
    "I\u2019m right there with you my friend. I\u2019ve been anxious lately and i feel like I\u2019m going to bust out crying and eating is a challenge. I think the quarantine is making me worry about being sick in general and it\u2019s making me anxious. Stay strong and cause I\u2019m right there with you.",
    "Same",
    "Claustrophobic is a good word. I feel that way. I\u2019m in a stay at home city, wear a mask and social distance. Plus I\u2019m in self isolation because it\u2019s assumed I have coronavirus by all my doctors + ER doc. The only reason I get to go out is to walk my dog. I have a couple of projects I want to do, but I have so much trouble focusing. \n\nI hope you get through all this ok. Remembering the therapy techniques will certainly help.",
    "Hang in there!",
    "Yea, me on a daily basis only now it's getting slightly worse and depression and I guess my anxiety could be now considered paranoia.",
    "This will all be over soon.  Until then, use technology and FaceTime your loved ones.  Tell them how much they mean to you.  Hope you can find some happiness in these times, it\u2019s not easy.",

    "I understand it is a very difficult situation for you. Please talk things out however hard it may be. \nDon\u2019t worry about a future that may never come. Yes, it may sure happen but like last time, you will sail over it I am sure. You are only 40, so why worry so much. Loads of years to work and pay off anything.

I\u2019ve become a lot more appreciative of the plants that grow in my backyard. I started cutting some and putting them in vases. Even a leaf from a calla lily plant in the right vase can brighten up an area. \n\nAlso, like many, I started cooking and baking again. I found recipes for dishes and desserts I always thought about making. It\u2019s been therapeutic. \n\nBe safe out there :)",

    "Yeah I usually just deal with dysthymia, this is full blown depression.\n\nMy psychiatrist just prescribed me Wellbutrin. I can\u2019t speak to my therapist as she\u2019s doing telehealth only and I\u2019m not in a private living environment.",

    "Same. Ik live with an abusive family and school was my only escape :( I've been way more suicidal lately",
    "Thanks for the reply. Therapy techniques are helping. I keep reminding myself when I get negative thoughts about the past that I dont need to dwell on them. The thoughts always relate to someone doing better than me in life and that I have let my life pass me by. However, I have struggled sine I was young with my thoughts and they really took hold of me. Despite my negative thoughts I have achieved things in my life but I unfairly compare myself to other people. But now, thanks to therapy I am coping better. Once this is over I am hoping to go back to college to learn something new that interests me. I hope that everyone comes through this okay once this awful situation passes. Take care.",
    "Okay thanks.",
    "Yeah I just hope that the end comes quickly I couldn\u2019t stand months if this :/",
    "My anxiety has also gotten so bad that I consider it paranoia. This isn\u2019t the first time, but this is definitely the worst. I went through a patch about 2 weeks ago where I was convinced that I was being poisoned (and it coincided with bad acid reflux which didn\u2019t help) and when this happens I STRUGGLE to take my medication which obviously just makes everything worse. I was also convinced that my mother and my cat were spying on me and constantly watching me. \n\nI am also TERRIFIED to leave the house. Even just going outside into my garden was really difficult at first. If I had planned a supper and I didn\u2019t have an ingredient, I would change my whole meal instead of going to the small shop down the road which almost always has no people in it. I also can\u2019t wear an n95 mask because I don\u2019t like anything touching my face and I feel like I can\u2019t breathe in them and that sets off an panic attack. \n\nLuckily the paranoia has (mostly) passes but the anxiety is still VERY REAL. I hope you feel less alone now. And if anyone has any tips, please share!",
    "It's a character action game that I am working on. I would compare it to the Legend of Zelda only that its a little bit more gritty I guess. I really like it and I like the people I work with, so that is a positive in all of this.",
    "Most definitely. I also read up on recoveries and such. The news outlets, especially the ones here in the US, seem to thrive on sensationalism. For all the doom and gloom out there, the more fact filled, straight laced stories fall the way side.\n\nWhile the state I currently live in, NM, seems to be handling the whole thing better than some, I've been appalled by the lack of care from most that live here in this stateline community. Being right next to TX, there exists that more militant \"my rights\" type of mindset that some just have to be proudly vocal of. Of course I've been dealing with that on some level since moving out here eight years ago. So again, really thinking the next best thing once this all settles down a bit is to run with my move into a further remote area.\n\nOf course apart from a small subsistence garden, I'll probably have to look into some other profession that doesn't require leaving the future homestead much. Kind of a hard thing in and of itself to do when I barely graduated high school 19 years ago and have only recently managed to get my footing in a troubling subject like college algebra.\n\nOn the upside of things, I wouldn't call myself defeatist in taking this further isolating route. Never have been in a relationship and don't have kids of my own. So perhaps all those years of staying on the outside of that drama has somewhat prepped me.",
    "Of course we don't have an exact date or something, that's right. But at least we know it won't last forever... that's just what I wanted to say.\nIt's really hard to stay positive atm and that's just one thing that helps me a little bit.",
    "Thank you, you too. You have great friends!",
    "The mind is so funny. I consider myself a \u201chomebody\u201d and semi anti-social. The only time I go out is with my little one (beach, pool, kid museum etc) but personally I\u2019d rather stay home. Now that I \u201chave\u201d to stay home, all I want to do is go out and be social lol",

You can go for a walk and talk with her. You could stand outside. You can take a bath or just chill in the bathroom. Wellbutrin is much more effective when you combine it with therapy.",
    "I know exactly what you mean about \u201cnegative thoughts... but unfairly compare myself to other people.\u201d I\u2019m not past it, but have gotten better. Living in the city I\u2019m surrounded by people with wealth, higher incomes, better apartments, etc. I used to feel bad every time I went out. I\u2019ve started to focus on the fact that my life is my life and what I truly need to focus on is me and getting \u201cbetter\u201d whatever that means for me. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re coping with it too. I hope we all bounce back, but realistically some won\u2019t and I hope the rest of use will be there to offer support on the sub/reddit. \n\nAll the best to you.",
    "Yea, I've found that trying to make a routine and keeping busy works for me.",
    "I already had different types of mental health issues undiagnosed that were similar symptoms to like generalized anxiety, depression, adhd, autism, dp/dr, even possibly some personality disorders like ocd which already significantly affected my life in certain ways. I'm more paranoid now in the way you described, feeling that someone could've poisoned me, that my family including my dog is out to get me, that others besides them are out to get me, that I'll be abandoned, I'm more angrier/short tempered now too which is normal for me but it's more intense, same with being depressed which is also normal for me but more intense, I still feel happy sometimes but not as often, I'm more nervous than normal, can't stop thinking about my loved ones and them dying or leaving me behind more so than normal, feeling that there might be cameras watching my every move which is why I had to end a walk with my dog, not trusting anyone, having hallucinations I guess is what you'd call it, either not eating for long periods of time or binge eating, sometimes not sleeping at all or having breaks in sleep, like sleeping a few hours and then waking up and going back to sleep, having a harder time interacting with others in general, hiding out in my room, being more impulsive and/or compulsive then usual, sometimes clean my room alot or don't clean at all, sometimes don't shower at all, being overly energetic sometimes and depressed other times, more mood swings that are significantly dramatic, etc. I'm already an overly emotional person but sometimes it gets worse than usual and other times I feel nothing. It just gets to be to much that I completely shut down. I just distract myself and sticking to a schedule helps, routine is normal for me. I have to have a routine or I'll shut down. Anything that goes against routine can shut me down. Idk about tips other than maybe find something you can put your time into doing that distracts you.",

I reached out for help. Some of it is helping, some of it not. Mostly just actively doing something to reach out or help myself, is helpful  in and of itself.\n\nAnyway...That's how it's been for me.

In no way shape or form is this your fault.\n\nIMO, there is no excuse for parents to behave this way regardless of political affiliation. Treat her as you would if a coworker, friend, cousin, stranger talked to you this way (ONLY in the sense that there is NO excuse for their behavior and you would cut off communication with those people, and her being your mother doesn\u2019t grant her any level of automatic forgiveness). \n\nIf you used to have a good relationship with your mom or community that turned sour, I\u2019ve done some light research on the whole \u201cChristianity in politics\u201d thing that may help if you feel confused. Because I too have been dumbfounded by the last 4 years, increasingly so each day, losing faith in humanity both from a spiritual aspect as well as a government aspect. **I know that this won\u2019t fix anything and in NO WAY does it excuse your mother\u2019s, or ANY other Trump supporter\u2019s behavior. I only wish to help ease the part of your mind that is confused on the WHY, so you can let go of the grief and confusion and live your life as you please, whatever that may look like.**\n\n* Now in the 80s, the first religious political organization \u201c[Moral Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Majority)\u201d gained traction and was so successful in the Reagan campaign, many say it\u2019s the origin of the mainstream belief that \u201crepublicans = Christian\u201d. This is also the beginning of political and religious organizations using each others followings for leverage.\n\n* Christians actually tend to vote more democrat as a WHOLE demographic, across mainline sects, whereas Evangelical voters, who is the group we hear a lot about in politics today, tend to lean republican ([2016 Religious Groups and Polical Leanings](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/23/u-s-religious-groups-and-their-political-leanings/) (take a look, I think you\u2019ll be surprised by catholic!). Keep in mind this study was done in 2014 - so pre-Trumpism.\n\n* Trump\u2019s appeal to \u2018Christian\u2019 (but actually Evangelical) voter squad is more to do with cultural alignment of what they think is \u201ca real man\u201d. I know... it sounds too ridiculous to be true. [This](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-white-evangelicals-love-a-mean-tough-son-of-a-gun-like-donald-trump-11598540777) article on MarketWatch (sub of WSJ) explains how the Evangelical ideals of a man was a \u2018pull up from your bootstraps, tough son of a bitch\u2019 kinda guy. Sound familiar? It\u2019s almost too ridiculous for me to type, but it explains how DESPITE Trump\u2019s totally obvious hypocrisy on all religious values, these ppl still vote/worship him because to them, that\u2019s what a \u2018MAN\u2019, therefore a \u2018LEADER\u2019, therefore an \u2018AMERICAN\u2019 looks like (I could go on but I think the ties to racism, homophobia, capitalism, and The American South are pretty clear from there on out). I\u2019m sure this is not the only explanation or origin - it is also the same with Reagan, that he was the \u2018pull up your bootstraps, American dream, business owner, \u2018not a politician\u2019\u2019 guy.\n\n* Basically, it\u2019s primarily that the rich, old guys that have run these political and religious orgs/groups have COMPLETELY manipulated the people that follow them for their sole personal gain, and it\u2019s been going on for about 40 years. Literally a dozen or so vanilla white dudes have run these \u2018organizations\u2019, first appealing to their follower\u2019s existing beliefs and gathering a faithful fan base, and manipulating the people by indoctrinating beliefs that maximize their own personal gain in one way or another (like... basically how pyramid schemes and cults work). They\u2019re so good at it too, that basically no matter what evidence or facts are presented, these leaders have \u2018blind faith\u2019 from their supporters that they are explicitly exploiting. \n\n* In the Obama era\u2019s progressive legislation, for reasons that are probably obvious, these leaders were pissed that their \u2018advantage\u2019 had been taken away because they were no longer able to exploit the system they\u2019d set up for themselves (taxes, along other things).  So. Doing what they do. They tell their followers that basically anything progressive = punitive for their \u2018group\u2019. They truly convinced their followers that they were being oppressed by the Left, that \u2018equality for everyone\u2019 really meant \u2018unfairness for US\u2019 & that the Left was trying to \u2018exploit\u2019 them through the legal system by taking OUT religion (ahem... clearly hypocritical).\n\nThat all being said. The only reason I know all this isn\u2019t to make excuses. It\u2019s literally because I could not fathom how 2016 happened and how people could seriously be so narcissistic/uneducated/blind. I cut out Trump supporters from my life and from taking up room in my head once I came to the realization that there was no level of evidence, facts, proof, or logic that would explain what happened (and one of Trumpism\u2019s most horrible crimes is the demonization of evidentiary support  - \u2018if it\u2019s not saying what I want it to say, then it must be fake\u2019). \n\nRegardless of your decisions on relationship with mom and your personal beliefs, I hope this helped at least lend some clarity that your beliefs are valid, you are not alone, and some insight on \u2018how could this happen\u2019. I\u2019m not even implying that your mom is a victim in this situation, there\u2019s reason that many people are \u2018turned off\u2019 by religion as a whole right now because of these extremists (including people that probably used to go to church with them). The people that were left standing, blindly believing... well, consider them like the group of teenagers that goes out murdering because Charles Manson tells them to (wish that were more figurative than it actually is).\n\nWishing you the best.",

    "\"Maybe if we're super nice to the fascists, they'll change their mind.\"\n\nThis is tone-policing respectability politics bullshit. These people literally support white supremacy. At what point do we stop coddling them and expect them to be normal adult functioning members of society? \n\nTheir \"values\" include genocide, rape and death, and essentially boil down to \"eradicate the other side\". It is not on us to figure out why they agree with that or be polite to it. \n\nAlso, Trump supporters ARE in a cult. This isn't hyperbole that \"tells you something\" about OP. They exhibit a blind faith and religious fervor, extending to the point of dying for the imagined reality they live in.\n\nPlease understand that the way you are talking is incredibly condescending. Not every problem can be solved by being kind, and some people are just unrelentingly SHITTY. You can't magically make that untrue by putting yourself in their shoes, nor can you accurately put yourself in the shoes of someone who ignores all logic anyway.\n\nHave you ever considered that maybe, just maybe, OP and those like us HAVE done the work to see their perspective, and it is exactly WHY we're so angry? Sure, in a perfect world, we could all have the patience and grace of a saint and being socratic with them would work. But that's not where we are, and telling children who are being emotionally abused by their parents that it's THEIR fault is morally reprehensible.\n\nIt's perfectly fine to try and help a hurt person to think through their problems and arrive at a way to accept what they cannot change. But telling a hurt person that it is THEIR responsibility to change to suit the behavior of the person who is hurting them? THIS is your answer?",

    "I'm getting too old to give people the benefit of doubt anymore. If you support trump, you not only support his politics, you support his racism, misogynistic attitudes, his pettiness, his refusal to concede, etc, etc. Also known as sedition, and treason, both of which carry significant punishment. If covid doesn't get them, they all need to be rounded up and sent to Russia, where they'll like the politics better. America will be better off without them. Sadly,8\nI've e ghosted a number of people over the last 4 years. While as sad as it is, my mental health, and life in general, is far, far better without them in my life. Does it suck? Absolutely, but my health is better off without them, and I should have done it years ago.",

    "When people say shit like this it makes me laugh tbh. You don't really know what you're talking about so please try to do some research or have more empathy for people before posting stuff like this.\n\nMost people, when they first realize they're not \"normal\" band together with other folks like them. That can be gays, trans people, or straight dudes that like musical theater. Outcasts band together.\n\nBeing trans specifically, there are some specific milestones that most binary trans people go through, like starting therapy, getting on HRT, getting surgery, etc. Most people I know, once they're past the initial stages of transitioning, go \"stealth.\" This means that they're not openly trans anymore because they can \"pass\" as a cis person in their preferred gender. I guarantee you've probably worked with a couple people in this stage of their life.\n\nPersonally, I'm 27 and have been transitioning since 21. I'm pretty well past the point where I hang out with only other trans people, and have been \"stealth\" in my professional life for more than five years at this point. I stated that I'm trans on this post because it is a cultural shorthand for liberal politics.\n\nBeing trans or participating in \"trans culture\" is not comparable to supporting an authoritarian political candidate over your own child.",

Neither of those things are going to make me happy, and I suspect the same might be true for you. The statistics tell us that people arent happier when they earn more than they need. I can't change what I have lost, and I accept that. That does not mean that I can't look forward to the future and enjoy what that has to offer.

And perhaps where I am right now cannot handle who I would've been, and I would have suffered even more. Maybe I'm not where I wanna be, but who I am right now is only because of the challenges I've faced as a direct result of my mental health.

It wasn't until around when I turned 22 that I finally felt like I was able to understand and express who I really am and who I want to be.\n\nSometimes I regret those times, but I feel it's normal to have some struggles or bad situations that you have to fight through. For me, it's been really hard for me to actually know what I want vs. what others want from me, which meant I spent a lot of time doing what my family wanted or what my ex wanted. But it wasn't a waste...I've learned a lot about myself and about the world in the process.

It\u2019s a special kind of empathy and creativity and understanding of things. The only problem is the mental illness holds us back from being able to share those amazing qualities because it\u2019s like this evil force that wants to do away with the hero the world needs.

    "I have a bachelor\u2019s in psych and couldn\u2019t agree more. The one thing I learned that blew my mind the most was about Sigmund Freud. He did extensive therapy and interviews with upper class white women to try to determine the cause of their \u201chysteria.\u201d He discovered through these sessions that many of them had been/were being sexually abused by their fathers, uncles, church leaders, or other men in positions of power and that as a result they had developed what we now call PTSD. He published this discovery and was basically laughed out of town and completely discredited by his peers because these women couldn\u2019t possibly be abused if they had come from upper class, well respected families.  Freud was forced to change his theory to what it is today... That the women he studied were having sexual fantasies about their father figures which caused their hysteria. \n\nThink about how much further along we\u2019d be if we based all the research we\u2019ve done since then on his original theory instead of his alternative theory? \n\nI could go on for hours about this, but if you want to know more (and have it explained better), Judith Herman goes into it in detail (with sources) in the first chapter of her book \u201cTrauma and Recovery.\u201d ",

Probably an early adolecense: we have some pretty solid bases to understand what causes what, but we're still figuring out the best ways to approach it, and sometimes other interests ($$$) lead us stray.\n\nWhich is not to say that drug therapy or the pharmaceutical industry are bad, evil or ineffective- we're not talking about homeopathy here, psychiatric medine works, saves lives, and sometimes is the only thing that will help.

    "I've been doing some deeper reading about bipolar, and it's fascinating. There's obviously a parallel with unipolar depression, but there are parallels with schizophrenia and ADHD as well. \"Full blown\" manic episodes with psychotic features can look like schizophrenia. The racing thoughts in (hypo)manic / mixed states lead to problems with concentration and focus, similar to ADHD inattentive type. Throw in the restlessness and energy of (hypo)mania and it can look like hyperactive-impulsive type or combination type. This is especially true with adolescents - bipolar is often misdiagnosed as ADHD. It's also hypothesized that ADHD somehow *transforms* into bipolar as they age.",

None of my psych professors mentioned this, and maybe I\u2019m naive in thinking (or hoping) that they wouldn\u2019t intentionally leave this out, but apparently there\u2019s a book called The Freudian Coverup by Florence Rush if anyone wants to investigate further. ",
    "I didn\u2019t expect a learned psych person to show up and read my comment. I apologise for my extensive use of over-generalising language, earlier. I do accept that not everyone in the medical establishment is small minded and arrogant. Evidently, you wouldn\u2019t be someone I would have included in that assessment.  \nAlso that information about Freud was fascinating. I have had a fairly low opinion of Freud for a long time but this is something I really have to investigate!",
    "Whoaaa \\*mind's blown\\*",
    "I understand that his theory would be ridiculed back then, but with the whole metoo wouldn\u2019t his real theory be taught? Just 2 years ago I remember not really liking the guy bc apparently I\u2019m attracted to my family... yea right ",
    "What book/publication would you recommend  I should read by Frued? I want to learn more about him and his theories. I honestly agree sexual abuse at a young age causes a lot of mental health issue in adults. ",
    "You make a great point. Being from a country with a public health system, I hadn\u2019t considered it. Although, it\u2019s far from perfect here too. Funding for mental health treatment is low so waiting times are huge and therapy is very formulaic. Therapists tend to prescribe medication and tick boxes on a therapy checklist. ",
    "There is an arrogance in the medical community. There always has been and it makes progress very slow. Nobody likes to think they spent 10 years studying incorrect material. Nor do people like committing their whole life to mental health research only to be told it was all wrong. Imagine putting your name to all this research, essentially endorsing it as truth, then finding out its wrong. It would be humiliating.  \nNeurology is bridging the gap, as far as I can tell. There is studies now showing that people can have mental health problems which prevent them from properly moving their limbs and adequately evacuating the bowel and bladder. And when you think about it, that\u2019s kinda obvious. No doctor questions the fact that having a broken leg, or being hungry all the time, could make you depressed, but they can\u2019t accept that the reverse could be true also. There is a belief that the physical body can affect the mind but they refuse to believe that the mind can\u2019t affect the body, in the same ways.  \nUntil they accept that everything is connected and stop making mental health a separate issue, no progress will be made.",
    "Sorry to hear that you\u2019re touch through some difficult stuff. Currently, I\u2019m having some talking therapy and I have found that it\u2019s going pretty well, so far. It\u2019s not with a psychiatrist but a councillor. Albeit, a very highly trained councillor trained in a few different disciplines. I managed to find a pay-what-you-can afford councillor which has been very helpful. Just keep moving forward, no matter what. Search for help as best you  can and don\u2019t be hard on yourself. Yes TS been a very long journey for me I\u2019m only just starting to get help now. It\u2019ll be worth it when I complete my therapy. And it will be worth it for you, too. Hang in there, buddy.",
    "Yes I\u2019ve notified this exact same pattern. There\u2019s also a whole load of illnesses lumped under the umbrella of \u201cneurological\u201d which are treated by a neurologist. But nobody knows the cause. And these are things like people being unable to walk, poop, urinate just to name a few. They find there\u2019s no physical damage but doctors keep finding that the patients have had severe trauma.  \nI knew someone who was a victim of severe and prolonged abuse. She started having seizures every week or so. Eventually, she was sent home with loads of wires stuck to her scalp to measure brain activity for 24 hours. I witnessed her have a seizure during that time by the scan showed nothing. I couldn\u2019t make the movements this girl was making, myself. She was vibrating so hard for so long. Yet physically there nothing wrong. They called it a psychological seizure\u201d.   \n\nThen there\u2019s another illness called \u201cFoulers syndrome\u201d (not sure on the spelling) where women suddenly can\u2019t pee, usually forever. The professor who discovered it insists that it\u2019s a a physical cause. But the urologists who treat it keep reporting that the women have been sexually abused. All of them. The professor who discovered it has a responsibility to investigate these claims but she refuses to. It\u2019s too controversial.",
    "And then if you don\u2019t have insurance to afford the pills and therapy accessory its even worse.  (In all realness though my heart goes out to you friend. Mental illness is rough and I know how it be)",
    "I have been diagnosed with bipolar for a while and recently was diagnosed with ADHD. My psychiatrist said they very often go hand in hand, like 70% or some crazy number. Bipolar is such a blast, you get 4 mental illnesses in one! ",
    "Not to mention the similarities that Bipolar has to personality disorders. Which needs therapy not medication. It\u2019s all very very interesting. ",
    "The area I'm in, there is no resident psychiatrist so you see a different locum one every three months ",
    "I got my degree last year, and this was only mentioned in the class I took on trauma. I took that class in my final year and was so angry that none of my teachers had thought this was important enough to mention when we discussed Freud previously. \n\nI so, so wish that he had stuck to his guns as well. If we could have just accepted back then that sexual abuse is an epidemic, even within well respected families, then we could be so much further along now towards addressing the issue and actually having defined treatment plans for people with PTSD.

    "Oh, tell me about it. Here in Mexico mental health is a nightmare. Anyone can call him/herself a \"therapist\" and do whatever nonesense, and since our politicians are even more ignorant about mental health than they are in other subjects (And they are very ignorant of most subjects), they get a free pass or worse, government funding to do their crap. Finding a therapist, even in a government institution, eventually comes down to luck: Will you get a therapist who cares and is properly educated, or will you get some idiot that quotes \"The Secret\"? There's no way to tell. And I don't think south America is any better.\n\nApparently it is much better in Europe. And research-wise in Europe and the U.S.",
    "I completely disagree. It is actually the lack of arrogance what makes scientific advances so slow. Everything must be tested and replicated repeatedly to ensure there is no error, before it is established as reliable and new research can be built on top of it.\n\nYou can actually see it when paradigm shifts ocur. The paradigm shift is actually made, usually in a relatively small institution, very quickly, but is not even shared to others until several tests mark it as viable. Once shared all new institutions have to replicate whatever experiments have been done to corroborate to accept this shift, which is why the shift takes very long to spread. If you look into it, you'll see many radical shits were actually made in the 80's, and we just now getting to hear them, for this reason.\n\nArrogance would be what the alternative \"medicine\" practicioners do: insist they've got it right, everyone else had it wrong, and go with it demanding acceptance even in the absences of throough evidence. Alternative \"medicine\" advances pretty quickly in contrast to regular medicine for this reason: see how long it took us to get from \"Maybe the body affects the mind too\" to \"Cancer is caused by your thoughts and through my 'psychotherapy' I can cure cancer\" (BioNeuroEmoci\u00f3n or Bioneuroemotion or whatever), or how fast we went from \"Family relations reliably affect the mental health of the individuals of the family\" (Systemic family therapy, which is legit) to \"You are conected to your ancestors and your depression is caused by the spiritually transmited trauma your great-great grandmother had a hundred years ago\" (Hellinger's nonesence) precicely because while the institute of Millan was thorough in its testing and humble to say \"We think, but we're not sure it is true yet\" and took its time, Bert Hellinger just declared his method was a breakthrough and started giving seminars everywhere.\n\nFreud is another example. He didn't really test his ideas. He falsified evidence and ignored evidence that his theories didn't work, or outright hid it to preserve his image. His ideas were impresive (even if not accurate) and he right away went to declare it truth and go on teaching. Sadly psychoanalists everwhere today still hang on to those nonesensical ideas and just won't let go, despite both evidence that Freud was wrong and theories about the mind that explain it way better than Freud's ever did. But there's nothing more arrogant than a psychoanalist, so don't expect them to let go soon.\n\nScience moves at the speed of stone, but its results are solid.",

    "You\u2019re in a really advantageous position. You know how to trigger they self-shaming conformist side of your mind. You even basically allude to seeing it as a separate thing. \n\nConsider what\u2019s going on in your brain. Your neurons fire for a concept - and these neural firings for the things you like for no reason are who you are - but then another part of your brain comes in and shames it for even firing to begin with. This is another part of your brain that is telling that source of inspiration that it shouldn\u2019t be this way, that is, you shouldn\u2019t be this way. That there\u2019s something with how your brain works and that it should work a different way. But that\u2019s impossible because the things your neurons fire for have no rhyme or reason.  You are who you are, and this is who you are fundamentally. You alter this fundamental self. \n\nThe reason you are in an advantageous position is because knowing how to ambush this negativity allows you to alter it. At some point in your life you were shamed by another for sharing something, but now that person is long gone. What they left in you in that moment is machinery that does their work for them. So now instead of them shaming you, it is another part of you shaming you. But you can capture it, alter it and turn it into an ally. You see, we are born without boundaries. We need others to help us form those boundaries.  Children drown in pools because their neurons fire for the big blue puddle, but they don\u2019t have any concept of being safe. Safety is a boundary that stopes neuronal firing from killing you. We need boundaries, but boundaries can be malformed. Mom says \u201cdon\u2019t go near the pool!\u201d which he again and attack on the fundamental self. She saying your neurons shouldn\u2019t fire for pool, that there\u2019s something wrong with you. Instead mom should say \u201cwe can go in the pool but stay in the shallow end until you\u2019re ready for the deep end\u201d which instead tells us that there\u2019s nothing wrong with our brain but that we should act in a safe manner. What you have is a malformed boundary that exists too close to the source of that firing. It\u2019s too quick to extinguish the inspiration! But now they you know how to trigger it, you can capture it in your hands and make it move back a few passes to let the neurons breath. \u201cListen, you will now be my friend and will chime in to make sure that what I\u2019m doing doesn\u2019t harm myself or others. There\u2019s is nothing wrong with me or my neuronal firing so step back over here and help me be safe.\u201d\n\nThis will be uncomfortable at first, you\u2019ll feel they numbness, but if you can create a healthy boundary you will be free to post whatever you want whenever you want, as long as it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone or yourself.

I'm sure you're not a burden and I'm very sorry you feel that way. Much love to you especially in this tumultuous time!",
    "Yeah I feel this all the time.",
    "yep this is abandonment issues and dissociation, i experience this very regularly",
    "Sounds like anxiety. I totally get this. I try to remind myself that feelings are not facts. When I feel like I have been annoying or someone is bothered by me I look at the facts... Have I actually been annoying? Did my friends actually say something to me about it? I also have some people that I goto to check these things. Like I'll call my mom, \"am I really a burden on everyone I love? Am I really talentless? Am I really  worthless? Does everyone really hate me\" many of us cannot trust our feelings to be based on truth and that's why it is great to have a sounding board!",

Then I think how no one really gives me as much time or energy as I think I give them so it \u201cshatters\u201d me into a numb mindset like you said. Something similar happens in person and I go quiet and then just sit in my head with all my spiraling negative thoughts and it can put me in a depressive, or at least non-responsive, state for anywhere from a few minutes to a whole day. Other times if it\u2019s stuff that irritates me I just snap and get mad and then don\u2019t want to deal with anything which then puts me into one of these states too. It freaking sucks",
    "There right now.  Hubby questioned why I did something the way I did because now it\u2019ll take him days to get just right again. That sounded petty but let me try to explain. He has 6 bed pillows on the couch that have to be arraigned in a particular order for comfort. This is where he sits and sleeps. He is in pain constantly due to a broken back 20 years ago. So he marked the cases so he can put them back right then threw them in the washer.  My crime was I took the cases off so they could dry more completely. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve shut down and keep thinking how I\u2019m a complete screw up, I don\u2019t deserve anything from him or nice for me. \n\nI know it\u2019ll blow over and how I\u2019m feeling isn\u2019t true. But for now I\u2019m stuck in my head. \n\nTry to be easy on yourself and you\u2019ll feel better in a day or so. But, yeah it sucks.",

I felt like I was annoying, and taking up space in someone's day. I don't quite get numb, I just fall into a pretty sharp depression. Sleep usually helps me to get out of my funk.",

This was more about how I internally beat myself up. \n\nIn his defense, it is 6 pillows not 6 days. His pain can be intense and because alcoholism runs in his family he will only take a pain killer when he can no longer take the pain (he\u2019s had his current bottle of 90 for about a year now). Weather and stress increases the pain and it\u2019s been hot, humid and damp here daily for more than 3 weeks and it\u2019s approaching the anniversary of his mother\u2019s death. \n\nI offer that info to explain, not to defend. It was an uncalled for comment he made but I\u2019ve yet to meet anyone who doesn\u2019t occasionally say something uncalled for. It was about how I react. Thank you.",

    "Abandonment issues simply mean that you have a great fear, that your actions will be perceived negatively, and thus will have a negative impact on your social relationship. It shows a fear of being vulnerable and a lack of self-confidence.\n\nYou must become grounded enough in yourself, that you know what your core values are, and you realize what can't be compromised for you. You must be brave, and not be afraid to place yourself in a vulnerable position.\n\nTo find out what is true for you personally, you must watch your thought and behaviour patterns, from a neutral non-interfering seat of awareness.",
    "Just as a side note, the theoretical framework that OP is using to advise you would not only include a fear of abandonment for such behaviour but also (or instead, depending) a fear of rejection.  \n \nThe difference between abandonment and rejection can be illustrated in many ways, for example: if you were given up for adoption by a family unable to survive and help you strive, it is abandonment (even when intentions aren't necessarily negative). If you were left by your family that had the ability to care for you, that could be rejection. I used family but it could be individuals or groups of people of any sort.  \nAn additional perspective on this framework is that the words are focused on *how you experienced* things, not on *what exactly happened*. It is about subjective experience, which is hard to untangle when it occurs in life, and even more so if it happens in formative years.   \n\nFinally, it's also worth noting that this is *one* approach to what could be affecting you, not an absolute theory of the world which stands true for everyone at all time.  \n\nHowever, the advice given regarding the observation of your thoughts, behaviours and beliefs, is one anchored in a type of more broadly tested therapeutic tool called CBT (Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy). It's getting a lot of praise in the last couple decades and most of it really isn't undeserved.  \nThere are free resources out there to try to approach that on your own, but there is really some merit to doing it with the help of a therapist. It's hard to go from nothing to being able to slow things down, think \"what am I thinking right now?\", or \"why did I think this just now? what emotion do I feel? what is the source of this emotion?\" etc.  \n\nIn any case, in the behaviour you described, you're not alone and there are ways to find a healthier life balance in the long run :)",
    "Amen",
    "View yourself as a separate entity, that is watching inert objects (thoughts and behaviour patterns) play themselves out. Don't get involved with them, don't try to fight with them. Simply observe.",
    "Accept the feeling in the moment and later on write down what triggered you \n\nThen once you have a decent list you can begin to pick up patterns in your triggers - those patterns will link back to your core beliefs of the world. \nAnd then you can assess whether those core beliefs are helpful or unhelpful and start to \u2018observe\u2019 when you are being unnecessarily triggered and push through your fear. \n\nEg of helpful vs unhelpful triggers. My core belief: I am not safe in any situation. Experience: my friends throw a surprise party for me. Trigger: everyone knew about this but me and I don\u2019t feel settled because I believe that I\u2019m not safe (this belief is what causes my feeling). Feeling: vulnerable, anxious and guilty that I\u2019m not enjoying something that should have been fun. \nThis core belief did not help this situation - if I had believed I was safe (by pushing through my initial core belief and actually accessing the situation at hand for what it was) I would have been excited by the party and I wouldn\u2019t have been triggered",
    "I recommend getting onto a therapist sooner than later, more often than not these things come with waiting lists unless you can go private. So the sooner you're on the list  you have already then taken the first step to getting a handle on things. Do you get these kinds of thoughts often?? X",

And you must remind yourself that you have not done anything wrong, nore are you in danger.",

    "Before my soul kitty, Binx, passed away from a congenital kidney disease, he used to lay on top of me at night almost like he was protecting me. I lived alone at the time and I got very lonely and depressed, and often cried myself to sleep. It was me and Binx against the world. \n\nI loved that cat so much and I know he loved me. He was in critical care at the vet for a couple of days for blood tests and evaluation. They said he hadn't peed the entire time. I walked in to see him and immediately he stood up and peed in his box. The tech said she had tried to help him stand up and go the whole day and he just wanted to lay there until he saw me. \n\nI remember when it was time to say goodbye, the vet let me take him home for one last night. He and I slept in the bathroom floor together away from the other cats. I just laid there crying and holding him. Angry that this was happening to him and hating myself for what I had to do the next day even though it was what was best for him. \n\nI remember that he was having trouble walking and he wouldn't eat or drink. I got really upset and just lost it. He got up and walked over to me and nudged me with his head and climbed into my lap. I can still see his little face looking up at me. He was pushing himself to his limit to make sure I was ok. That's the moment I realized he was hanging on for me. And that wasn't fair. \n\nI've always loved my cats and I always will. But Binx was special. He came into my life as a scrawny abandoned stray and when he left, he took a piece of me with him.\n\nI'm saying all of this because you need to know that your kitty did that for a reason. Out of unconditional love and care for you.\n\n\nEdited for typos.",

She was rarely affectionate but this time walked up to me and purred and cuddled on my chest and licked tears off of my face. \n\nThis really taught me something about how we as humans could be much more compassionate and supportive.

Why dont you just remember? \"\n\n Being colorblind isn't really that bad compared to some other mental illnesses I've struggled with including depression.  At least when you are colorblind you can understand that people just dont understand and laugh it off.",

Fail a test. \"Well whats the point of college\" \"Well whats the point of making a living\" \"Well whats the point of feeding myself\" \"Well whats the point of living\"\n\nMakes sense right? :)",

Are there social cues? Is it actually a chemical imbalance? Personal responsibility must come after there is some degree of motivation for it, whether it's directly via neurotransmitters or socially.",

    "You're right and that's why I agree that depression and other mental illnesses are more challenging to deal with.  That being said, not being able to tell what color something is can be funny but it's really frustrating and honestly exhausting as well.  I can't see red, but I see something that looks very much like green.  If I focus really hard in good light I can tell it looks like green but different so I know that's red.  Brown is like green but also different because it looks like that other thing little bit but more like green.  I can only so this at all of the colors are very vibrant(or not faded) and its tiring to try and tell what the color is for my brain and it hurts as well.  Everyone has their struggles and everyone's struggles are different.  Sont minimize others problems because you think your problems are harder(they might be but it doesn't matter because this isn't a pity contest)",
    "So wanting people to have meaningful lives makes him lack empathy?\n\nSo living nihilisticlly is better than a meaningful life?",
    "idk if this is related but I have read about and once experienced that I wanted to turn my life around when I feared for my life. It's not the same but relative to dopamine fasting, where you put away luxaries that keep you from focusing on the important stuff or sort of hit rock bottom so you HAVE to do something. Ie if I had no food, I would be forced to go get some. If I don't have to do something, I can't do it. Motivation is only there for me when others are involved, say me helping or such.",

    "Yeah no prob :)  you do have a point though about mental illness being woefully misunderstood, it's tough",
    "No. What makes him lack empathy is that he doesn't care about people who are suffering. He said he would stay away from them. Either that or he is afraid of the mentally ill. Either way, he would be a terrible therapist.",
    "Very impressive! Some people shut down in that scenario though. They don't care about food.  Or they are physically unable. The dopamine fasting is a bit misguided, because dopamine doesn't have to be related to a luxury. Even the very nature of a Dopamine fast is dopamine based. Some need that dopamine to even 'do that something'. Perhaps akin to how depressed people, even when treated, are zombies, just going through the motions. I have been there. Sometimes it's a good start to get to a better place, but it should not be the plateau. Life can be so much more. We both can.",
    "Yeah like I said, I disagree :)  \n\n\nPeterson has some good points, but he's not my guru. Meaning to me is more important (e.g. Viktor Frankl). Responsibility might fall under that.",
    "Ironically, Greeks were very aware of depression and Hippocrates (who coined the term Melancholia) is a big reason why. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d point the finger at big religion as the reason why Phycology look a big hit as the Romans and the Greek were a lot more open (reportedly) than we currently are in Western Societies.",
    "That is quite the statement to make.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/o_mR1pIbvoY\n\nWhy would he help this married couple who is suffering then and when did he say he would stay away from people suffering? :)",
    "Yeah Hippocrates had a pretty good idea of mental illness, especially for not having the technology and years of research we have today. He linked mental illness as being caused by physical ailments (imbalances of the humors) and the brain (which he saw as the center of thought, intellect, and emotion). \n\nI would also like to point out that the Greeks were still not perfect and stigma still did exist, especially for externalizing illnesses like schizophrenia which was thought to be punishment from the Gods and such. Still, I'm impressed with the the Greek physicians and how did seem to be going in the right direction with their basic understanding of mental illness and even treatments (i.e. prescribing exercise and forms of counseling)\n\nEdit: words",

You were still likely to be abandoned at a young age if you were fit for the life you were born into but Greek culture had a lot of uses for said children, unfortunately most of them were probably abused. \n\nInfanticide was very common in the ancient times. I believe most Greek homes had a clay urn in the front of their homes that they would put items that they didn\u2019t want/need and finding newborn babies in them were not uncommon. \n\nSo anyone that wanted a baby only had to walk the neighborhood...\n\nI\u2019m not sure how accurate that is but I did write a paper on the subject during my Ecology 101 class some 4-5 years ago.",

    "I feel you. I first got anxiety and depression when I was 12 and I've recently realised how much of an influence they've had over the 20 years since. And now I have extra anxiety and depression because I keep telling myself my life is ruined and I'm hopeless! \ud83d\ude43",
    "First (hug) I do understand this so very very well. I'll be 36 in January and my first cry for help was in third grade yes I promise third grade so I was roughly 8 I think... I have been hospitalized many times, seen loads of psych doctors tried loads of pills. They changed the DSM so I'm not sure what I'm even technically diagnosed anymore it was manic depressive ( just what they called it then)  at 16 BPD and bipolar. I knew it was worse I never felt right.. eventually they shrunk it all down to schizoafective bipolar disorder, which was the short of, Schizophrenia, bipolar ( heavy depression) DiD, BPD, and CPTSD and GAD... At 25. My doctor tried for 10 years to help and then decided I was medicine/treatment resistant, I was on a lot of meds he cold turkey pulled me off them... He recently gave me kolonopin for panic attacks. Other than that I have no more bandaids. I had to basically relearn how to be myself.. everyone always said I was a rainbow even though they had no clue (except my partners) who I really was and what I was going through. After years and years of not understanding myself and thinking oh no you've turned out to be exactly like the people who ruined you..  I decided to try and fix this messed up shit in my head.. I started learning about childhood trauma, and started understanding me better. I was trying to get into a CPTSD therapist but none seem to take my insurance. I bought work books and everything... I'm not saying I magically got better by any means I still fight depression and my schizophrenia. My DID has turned wild during this withdrawl mess, which is so hard for my husband... I went over three months just sitting in my bed starting at my phone being mad... I was even losing my cool with my boop puppy. Idk why but I've been granted with a few great days and I even got my art passion back... It's funny because my vet actually explained my dogs anxiety ( he came from a verrrrry bad situation.) Is like he's constantly trying to go up the hill but he can't reach the top.. idk why but that hit hard... I had dreams, I wanted to be a mom I wanted to do everything right that I didn't get, but I decided that bc of mine and my husband's genetics children probably weren't the best thing for us, not that everyone facing MI should make that choice but it is what's best for us.  So I let that dream die.. growing up I loved cartoons, anime, and video games I wanted in that industry some how, I had to be pulled out of school at 16 bc I was sick. I eventually got a little college,  but just couldn't hack it.  I had to let go of all my once dreams thanks to a shitty childhood and bad genetics... Medication can be a life savior for so many people even though the side effects tend to suck and you have to keep trying until you find the right combo or the doc throws in the towel in my case. I guess I want you to know that even though life may not end up what you once wanted and desperately hoped for happiness is still out there. Even though it took me 35 years to try and unfuck myself lol that's the title of one of my workbooks, I don't think it's ever to late to try and find your happy even if it's not what you expected.. so now my goals in life have changed to just working on my art and trying to be a better me.  \ud83d\udc9c sorry ugh I'm one of those ppl who never shuts up... Hopefully you find some ease in my word vomit, and if you ever need a friend im around.",
    "Yes I feel so much of this. Every bit of it actually. I lost all of my teens and early 20s to my eating disorder and I\u2019ve spent the remainder of my 20s trying to figure out how the hell I\u2019m supposed to navigate life without my disorder. A lot of the time I\u2019m depressed and disengaged without it, I find it hard to be motivated toward anything else. I am working on it and it\u2019s got a lot better in recent years. \n\nI\u2019m approaching 30 and it is getting better. My best friend suggested I come up with a \u201830 under 30\u2019 list and I\u2019ve been working my way through that. Now that I\u2019m actually making the effort to do these things in many ways I\u2019ve done more than other people my age even with the lost time. Bought and renovated a house at 25, I travelled at 26, had a baby at 27, I\u2019m starting a business and enrolling in university at 28. I started reading, crafting, candle making. I hope as covid eases I can start aerial lessons and drum lessons.  \nI had a child last year and with that I decided I\u2019m so DONE feeling like it\u2019s \u201ctoo late\u201d, it\u2019s never too late. It really isn\u2019t. Yes we\u2019ve lost time but in reality most people spend the majority of their lives muddling through and not doing much. \n\nAll I can suggest is use the lost time as motivation to live an intentional life.",
    "I feel that. I feel like I\u2019ve barely lived because of my depression. All those stories people tell about crazy nights or funny things they did or young romance? I don\u2019t have any of those. Depression does nothing but take and it never gives back anything.",
    "Absolutely, yes. I know this train of thought well.\n\nI try not to dwell on it, but periodically I think of how much more I could have achieved in life and how much more I would have experienced had it not been for mental ill-health. I try to focus on what I have done despite the difficulties. Or on what I am doing to try to improve my situation.",

    "I stopped working because of it. Still trying to figure my shit out. It's a neverending battle..",
    "I was just thinking today of who I could've been if I wasn't born with disordered anxiety. I could have done more with music and the other subjects I was interested in. I may have had an easier time with making true friends that I could connect with. I probably would have stood up for the things in my life that reflected who I am and felt right at the time instead of erasing myself and putting others before me at all times.\n\nBut I'm also kind of thankful for it too. Now I have this sensitivity to the feelings and experiences of others that I can apply in my personal life and in the classroom as a teacher. I think we need more teachers who are sensitive to the needs of students outside of education. It doesn't mean we have to step in as a psychiatrist or therapist, but it means it's not the end of the world if we see certain behaviours existing. Students have lives outside of school just as teachers do. Sometimes life is hard for a multitude of reasons. I can't wait to be that teacher!",
    "I spent my late teens and early 20s heavily struggling with depression and suicidal ideation. It immensely impacted on my goals and work ethic. I always thought \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of doing xyz I am going to die soon\u201d so I would procrastinate or not fulfil tasks when going through episodes then on days when I would feel better I would overwork myself to play catch-up then it just became a viscous cycle.\n\nI am turning 25 in November and I am much better. Though I do sometimes feel like I am behind and my peers are still doing far more for themselves than I am, I am trusting the process and focusing on rebuilding. Own lane, own pace is my mantra.",
    "I do wonder what my tween and teen years would have been like had I not binged eaten myself into a blob. I feel like I missed out on a lot of social and romantic experience and as a result don\u2019t really understand intimate relationships on a deep level.",

    "Absolutely. The losses and damages are severe and it\u2019s the most demoralizing aspect of trauma",
    "Yup I felt this on another level. Spent all my childhood in my room playing videos games all day which I still love don\u2019t get me wrong but I found nothing wrong in how my father controlled  the environment and didn\u2019t allow me to have any freedom until I forcefully moved out. I\u2019m finally free to do pretty much anything now but never traveled and don\u2019t have the money to travel currently at the age of 21. It gets to my head everyday of how much I haven\u2019t done and how much I\u2019m missing out but that\u2019s just me comparing to others which is obviously not the smartest mindset but I can say I\u2019m getting better at being my own mind and it\u2019s honestly a life changer. Hope everything gets better for you dude you got this!",

    "You're not alone. \nSometimes it's something I've to tell myself that. \nEspecially because your problems started when you were young. \nI had episodes of depression and anxiety in my youth and it got worse when I started working. Had to be hospitalized quite a lot. Couldn't finish my degree. Got hospitalized at the day of my last practical exam.\n\nWhile getting my degree I was absolutely sure, that if I don't get it I fail at life. That I'm not good enough, because I couldn't do what others can. \n\nNowadays I work and excel in a job environment that is completely different. I take my time to enjoy things I couldn't before. Thanks to the depression in school I failed subjects that I now love to learn. I enjoy watching children shows I didn't allow myself before. I go to the zoo or cook a kids meal, just because. \n\nTake your time to see what you have missed in your life and allow yourself to enjoy it. You survived till now, you got battle scars and you are still standing. Your life wasn't like the life of others. You're different,  but you are worth the same.",

    "I understand completely! I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at age 3. When I was 7 I got diagnosed with ADHD. When I was 11 I became suicidal. Most of my life thus far (I\u2019m 22) has been either abuse, control or neglect from parents, family, bad friends and relationships. After my second round at the mental hospital they switched me to outpatient classes where I had received an emotion chart because I never knew how to address my feelings. I had dealt with them since I can first remember so being depressed, anxious, and distant felt like everyday life. I\u2019ve always wondered what life would be like if I didn\u2019t have mental illness. But, without it, I wouldn\u2019t be me. I wouldn\u2019t be able to show compassion the way I do. If a lifetime of bullshit means I can help someone else out with theirs in a better way, then it\u2019s all worth it for me. \ud83d\ude0c",

We have to do what we can with all the pieces we've got, but some have more, some have less. I used to be so resentful to have to go to therapy just to barely function while others were living their lives. But now I tell myself: these are my Legos and I can't beat myself up about it, just do my thing. I can't turn back time, I can make use of the time I have now.",
    "I understand completely. I was struggling undiagnosed for years until my doctors finally came up with an actual diagnosis. I've gone through many doctors who have ignored/brushed me off completely and I finally got a doctor after 10 years who is listening to me finally and is working with me. \n\nI feel as if my entire 20's I was suffering from my problems and struggling to cope and self-medicate, in addition to the mental/emotional problems, I also was recently diagnosed with Hashimotos, which only exacerbates the situation. \n\nYou are not alone - It is a rough go, but I am somewhat hopeful for the future at this point. \n\nGood luck",

    "Yea, iam schizoaffective bipolar type. Am really afraid of continuing my behavior and it just getting worse. The drugs aren\u2019t helping, I guess they never did really, well maybe they did a few times. But not at wasting time, I guess except at work. You know you hear how money isn\u2019t important, I wish they would\u2019ve been a lil more specific about how it isn\u2019t important lol either way I was screwed the mania and hallucinations took away my chance at a fulfilling life and then the depression and anxiety just come back with new power, like now it\u2019s because I\u2019ve wasted over a decade, but as soon as I\u2019d get things on the right track everything would fall apart with another fit of mania. At least now I can collect disability, I\u2019ve just always been happier working I would say, I had it nice working on my one night stand dad\u2019s farm, but he won\u2019t talk to me anymore because of my felonies. Lol fuck him, his drunken sperm is the reason I have mental illness in the first place and then his bitch ass can just bail on the life he brought into this world and I\u2019m stuck suffering thru it. Nothing I can do but get sober and try to find a cash paying job, maybe then I can have some life in me to work and live for something more than getting high and playing video games. Still if it weren\u2019t for the full blown mania I wouldn\u2019t be the way iam, I don\u2019t care what society says much but I do care how it feels to waste away and hate it. The depression and anxiety I break by looking at life thru the eyes of a madman I guess, the hypomania is kinda nice to. It\u2019s just the full blown mania destroys everything and the hallucinations don\u2019t help at all. Hope your traveling turns out, just thought I\u2019d share hopefully it makes you feel a bit better about what feels like a waste, it can\u2019t be as bad as me, I spend 75-90% of my time alone. And the insanity is growing in ways that leave me in fear of a terrible last few years, with catatonic depression marred with tormenting voices. But if I can get sober I may be able to beat it with positive thinking as I rekindle my faith and love for God, people and life as we know it, rather than the way I\u2019ve seen it in my mind.",

The hardest part is the people you care about who are looking at you from the outside in, and they can't really understand you.

I only remember such sad traumatizing moments.",
    "Yes, and to validate you are not alone even more: This is exactly why so many that struggle with mental issues end up paying it forward and deciding to give more of their life to help others with their mental illness.

    "I'm 45 now and wasn't diagnosed until I was 41.\n\nIts amazing how much freeing it becomes once you understand why we felt the way we do for most of our lives prior to that. All of the gaslighting and the manipulation from people who said they \"care about us\" prior to all of it.\n\nIt really make you think are we the ones with \"mental health issues\" all because we are not ashamed of showing our feeling and following our hearts?  Or are the people who subjected us to abuse and all the other reason.  Maybe they are the ones who actually have the mental health issues.  Because they try to control others and tell us how to behave for example when we are not hurting anyone, yet they want to try and control our lives?\n\nThis is just me thinking out loud so take it with a grain of salt, given I an talking from my own personal experiences.  Be it from family, \"friends\" or where we work and how we get treated.  I just mean from the treatment we endured from these same people.  It makes me wonder how they would be if the tables were turned on them....",

    "Yeah. Absolutely. I made a similar post a few days ago, with the only difference that i had to make it uselessly long and tell my whole life story. But i do relate to you. What helps me is thinking that yes, you can't get back the time you lost but you can always start living NOW. Make your life about enjoying yourself and doing all the things you missed out on. Don't care about your age, it doesn't mean anything. You might have missed out on some stuff like teen romance, i know i did, but there's so much more beyond that. Romance will always exist. Be proud of the person you are and the things you achieved inspite all the mental issues you had to go trough. Just exist in the moment, focus on becoming your better self and start geniunely  enjoying life. Let go of expectations. Don't compare yourself to others ( easier said than done, but it CAN be done ). Forget all of the time you've lost, it doesn't exist anymore, it's not real, it doesn't matter. You exist in the present moment, you have your own life and you can do whatever you want. I hope you can be happy, good luck :)",

    "I think\u2026. I think I understand how you feel. I\u2019m still young (17) but my whole life has been a train wreck, and I feel like I\u2019m sitting in the locomotive. My dad died when I was 2. He was in a car accident, and I was supposed to be in that car. If it weren\u2019t for my aunt (may she Rest In Peace) I wouldn\u2019t be here today. After that day I lived with her in Illinois, as my mom was an addict at the time and I wasn\u2019t allowed to be with her. When I was 7, my mom \u201cgot clean\u201d and I was sent back to live with her in California. I didn\u2019t want to do it but I had no choice. Eventually, my mom, my grandparents, my other aunt, my uncle, my cousins and I moved up north to Washington. My grandparents and uncle were supposed to build property up there, but it never happened. While we lived there, we had to get used to the cold nights during the winter. On one of these nights, my mom, who was \u201cclean\u201d at the time got upset with me. I can\u2019t remember the reason. I think the reason I can\u2019t is because she decided to throw me outside for the night while it was snowing. I was in a tank top and pajama bottoms. I was only 9, and I had to spend around 3 hours until my uncle stopped by at around 11, and saw me. I don\u2019t remember much after that. It\u2019s memories like these that I try to push down., and that was just one of the horrible things I\u2019ve had to experience. I\u2019ve been abused both emotionally and physically, I\u2019ve spent the last 3 years in therapy, and I haven\u2019t seen my mom in the last 2 years. I know people will say that \u201cyou\u2019re young, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d but it isn\u2019t the case. I grew up in an abusive household. Trauma like this will never go away. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be truly ok. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be truly happy again, either. But everyday I try to tell myself, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be ok, just pretend to be happy and you\u2019ll be fine!\u201d But everyday my feelings get worse and worse. I don\u2019t know what to do sometimes, and honestly I don\u2019t know if there is anything I can do. I just keep pushing forward in life, because really that\u2019s all I can do.",

But needless to say I had a bad semester. I wasn\u2019t a bad student I always did my work and I have graduated from CC with 4.0 and got a scholarship to pay for most of my education. But I ended up with instructors that weeded the course work so much, half the classes were failing. The advisors were not so helpful nor was the student services. I was struggling both academically and socially because I find it hard to fit in a population of 40k students. I left because I knew it wasn\u2019t worth my time nor money for this school but I sometimes regret that things didn\u2019t go as I expected to be.\n\nI went back to CC to make up for my poor academic performance by taking fewer classes. But that\u2019s when the pandemic started. The moment when everything changed in bullet time. I did passed my classes but it was hard to get use to the online normality. Just as I was planning to transfer elsewhere my grandfather passed away in the summer 2020. Again, another moment that really changed me. I had no choice but to drop out of school for a year to clear my mind from all this. \n\nChristmas time was the worst, I ended up with Covid and was forced to spend quarantine alone. It was very lonely and I was at the point where I became suicidal.\n\nI know all of it was from the past but I still feel depressed and have no idea what to do after this nightmare ends. But I don\u2019t want to give up on myself.",
    "The last decade, to varying degrees, yeah. It's not too late for you. Ironically (this advice is \\*not a replacement for therapy and meds\\*) detaching from the need to fix it will help you enjoy the rest more.",
    "I'm almost 40.  I lost my older brother to suicide at 13.  It sent me into a spiral of cutting and depression that lasted til I was around 20.  That's when I got pregnant.  After an easy birth I suffered from extreme post partum, depression and anxiety. \n\n I lost my dream of art school and photojournalism to a haze of depression and medication.  I took almost 15 years of drugs and therapy to get to the point where I was fit to raise my son.  I still struggle daily and am on government supports.  \n\nWhile I don't regret my life, I love my child, I do wish I had done things differently.  I feel like I'm making up for so much lost time.  Don't wait   if you are young, travel.  See the world and all it has to offer while we still have a planet to enjoy.",
    "I feel this so much. I\u2019ve always wanted to travel the world but was so depressed and anxious I couldn\u2019t. I feel like I\u2019m finally getting better and want to do everything I\u2019ve been dreaming of. Thanks for sharing your story. Makes me feel less alone and I\u2019m sure a lot of other people too \u2764\ufe0f",
    "Yeah definitely",
    "Absolutely. I used to dwell on it but I really try to not do that anymore. What\u2019s the point? I can\u2019t have any of that time back which is really really sad but all I can do is live right now and make the best of it...and look forward to the future. You\u2019ll be able to make so many memories still. Plus, when I tell people about my life it\u2019s interesting to them. I\u2019m sure your story will be interesting to others you meet too.",
    "I'm a survivor of abuse, and my childhood was so fucked up that my therapist cries on my behalf when I bring it up. And that's been the case for every single one I've had. I've had 7 of them and they've all cried when I related stuff I thought was tame and more or less normal. I am terrified of having kids because while I won't hit them, I'm worried I'll say something fucked up and not even know I did anything wrong. My perception is so warped from the abuse that I don't understand love and intimacy. I probably do love some people. I have felt sad when people I knew died. But it's possible to row a boat without understanding the physics of how it floats. I feel like that's what I'm doing. I don't understand what I'm doing by loving others, but I do love them. This shit has swallowed up 24 years of my life. 10 of that I was abused. The other 14 I have been trying to recover from it.",
    "Big yes",
    "Mental illness is why I'm homeless. I come from a old school family that doesn't believe in mental health. They think I'm pretending... can't keep a job but I sure can get one. \nI get all weird and feel like everyone's trying to kill me then I start getting hostile and angry.",
    "Yes, especially when it came to relationships",
    "Yes. I also believe I may be keeping myself sick to some extent. I have addictive behaviors (4 yrs sober now) and was tsking about this issue to a friend who specializes in sobriety techniques. She shined a light on how it is possible that because of my addictive personality, I have become at peace with the bad thoughts that trigger my depression. That I have to an extent accepted them as part of who I am now, just like when I was addicted to drugs and alcohol. I had become obsessed with my diagnosis, always telling myself inside my head that I\u2019m depressed, ocd, GAD etc. So I think I am addicted to the thought of being sick. If I can quit drugs and alcohol, I can quit the bad thoughts. I am working on meditation self care yoga excercise and vegan eating (oops I had sushi today with mom, couldn\u2019t resist). I\u2019m taking some time off work to clear my head and focus on these things and elevating my mind state above the ego, being conscious of the language that I use and in my mind that contributes to my imbalances. I have been feeling better. But it\u2019s work just like anything else. You have to want to get better, just like I had to WANT to quit drugs and alcohol, so I did!  A good technique that I learned was giving myself credit for every accomplishment I make, and telling myself good job! Even if it is something as simple as brushing my teeth, which is next to impossible when I\u2019m severely depressed. I forced myself to hang out with a friend, and made two new friends! It feels good to have a tribe of people. I also would be conscious of how you are framing things in your mind. Instead the f thinking that you wasted so much time, focus on the fact that you recognize a problem and have the courage and love for yourself to find a way to change it. Only you are responsible for yourself, make a conscious choice to encourage yourself and gove yourself credit for all of your accomplishments and the ones you will achieve in the future. I know it is easier said than done, but I recommend a book that I\u2019m reading now called conscious language. It has some Jesus stuff in it here and there. I am not religious but even the Bible verses in there are very uplifting and helpful. We are all one, and little pieces of the same universe. And so I wish for you abundance and joy and all the blessings possible. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d n your journey to peace",
    "Yeah. It sucks. I have r/cptsd and I seriously think everyone here should check out that sub. I'm 22 and it seems like things are finally starting to get a little bit better for me mentally, but not exactly in the way I imagined. I still have all of the same issues, I'm just a lot more aware and know what to do. I don't always have the energy, though. I'm a lot better at coping so now I'm trying to work on healing. Fighting my brain can be exhausting. I'm prioritizing healing so I don't really have friends anymore, I've taken a few breaks from college, and I don't really do much.

    "I'm not sure who needs to read this, but please do. I NEVER post on reddit. Recently, my life has gotten pretty shitty, and I didn't really see a way out. I was very very low, and just wanted out. For good. Right at the fucking rock hard low, my dad dragged me out of bed(I'm 29, had a home, mortgage, very stressful but very good job, and I'm VERY good at what I do, but going through a very nasty divorce hence living with the old man), and said that a couple of my mates had voiced concerns about me. I'm not sure why they went to him instead of coming to me direct, but that's the way it went. He had a tea ready, and gave me the toughest love I've ever had. Told me that he knew shit wasn't right, and he didn't care what he had to do. We were talking about it there and then, because he had noticed I wasn't right too, and would rather have the worst discussion a parent could ever have with their kid, than find me dead with a note somewhere. Fucking laid it out right in front of me. No bullshit. Even when I tried to play it off, like a macho fucking dickhead, he just gave me a hug. Told me he knew. I let go, let everything go. Broke down like a toddler having a freak out about not getting that toy I'd just seen and instantly wanted. I TALKED. Rambled would be a better word. I spilled everything. Every feeling I had. Every thought I had. And I'm not that kind of guy at all. And do you know what? It fucking helped. I'm now seeing a counsellor, my work are giving me support. My mates are helping me through this shit time. Because I gave in and talked. Fellas, ladies, washing machines, whatever you identify as. Fucking talk to people. Because take it from me, it god damn helps, and it will fucking save your life. No matter how gone you think are. It will fucking save you. Someone out there cares for you. You are someone's thought. You are something. Just reach out. Because you are someone's something. If you're someone's stranger who just happens to be reading a reddit post, then you are someone. Get help guys, talk. Because I swear to you all, it gets better. It just doesn't seem like it right now. But it fucking does. I promise. Stay strong guys, its OK not to be OK. Don't bottle it up. Talk to someone. Please. Someone cares about you. I am living proof that there is light at the end of the very long dark tunnel. Please talk to someone guys if you're feeling like I felt. I don't check reddit a lot, but I will after this if anyone needs to chat. Knine4794",

    "I sometimes feel like my mental illness screwed me up as it meant I went from A* pupil to barely passing, or even occasionally failing which I'd never done before.

    "Sometimes it can make me depressed ironically",
    "Yes.... it hurts so deeply being so intimately connected to all the beautiful miracles that make up a human life because the very essence of human life; need, desire, passion, vision, love, curiosity etc. are all very active and present within but are silenced by a sobering truth that  those things, along with all our potential will be irretrievably lost if the brain remains broken.\n\nI was diagnosed with depression when I was 11. I've had anxiety in different forms since adolescence but the worst is my social phobia. I'm 30 and it has taken my life from me. The worst feeling isn't the pain you feel when you're younger... it's the full awareness that your capacity to feel anything at all is dissipating all together and all you have are memories of when the stakes were high and you'd do anything to feel okay. It's a very strange sense of loss. I feel so detached from that poor girl in the past... but angry that nobody helped her sooner, better. She lost her life and no one will ever know because here I am.... still alive.",

Those episodes of depression, giving up and losing will to go on cost me so much in my life. I'm turning 30 next month and feel like I wasted all my life. I lost all my friends, I can't find relationship and I'm also in debt. I don't want to use any medication and only thing that helps is marijuana but it has a lot of side effects too. So I don't use it very often. Sometimes I wake up and first thought is wishing my life was over. There is nothing that makes me happy or giving me any hope. The only reason I still live is my mother.

Having mental health issues is like combination of going to philosophy school combined with school of hard knocks. And you learn from that things \"normal\", healthy or privileged ppl don't. The thing is though, you will have the advantage since life is mostly suffering & meaningless - you need to create ur own meaning.

    "Depression is a hell of a thing but what I\u2019ve noticed helps people through bad moments in life is having someone who truly cares and talks to you. Not like a therapist but a friend whose willing to help and actually wants to help even if it\u2019s just them being there, if you see someone in a dark area. Talk to them and try to see if you can help in anyway by just being there or showing them kindness. It\u2019s not an immediate fix or would cure them. But it shows them that people outside of family care. That\u2019s why every Time a friend is down I usually know what cheers them up or helps them out of that state at least to distract them and that could be silly cute photos of animals or talking with them showing them they\u2019re not alone.

    "somewhat. i sort of relate to this. i don't know if i can actually call it depression or whatever because my mind tells me that it isn't.",
    "Yup. I always think I\u2019m faking it and I\u2019m just lazy but I know that\u2019s not the case\n\nOr if I have a couple good days in a row I start thinking that my depression is not THAT bad (even though I couldn\u2019t even bathe the week before, or just got out of the hospital post suicide attempt) \n\nMental illness is weird",
    "Absolutely. I don\u2019t feel sad. I just feel tired all of the time. Like no matter how much sleep I get, it won\u2019t be enough.",
    "I have pretty much felt this in the last couple of months. I've been assuming that things are not bad enough to stop trying to improve because if I stop, things will only be getting far more worse.\n\nAnd things are just getting worse. I feel guiltier everyday and the sense of loss only gets stronger. I thought it's all in my mind, but it's also everything that's around me.",
    "Negative self-talk can trigger this feeling. Lack of activity can make depression feel even worse than it already is. \n\nMelancholia, just that feeling of being 'blue' all the time makes it worse.  I found cranking up some upbeat tunes can sometimes 'reset' that \"I'm stuck in a puddle of mud and can't figure out where to go\" feeling.\n\nAnd do get outdoors. FORCE yourself to get out and walk. I know mostly we don't want to but it is Truly Beneficial.",
    "Multilayered spiral depression, yup alllllll the timmmeeee.",
    "Yes. I never realize how depressed I am until the episode is over or I have one day that isn't as bad. It's honestly night and day, yet I will never be \"depressed enough\".",
    "Yes. Like there\u2019s nothing really for me to be depressed about I just am. \ud83d\ude41",
    "Idk, like tired of being tired?",
    "Yes. Imposter syndrome.",
    "Yup, I've been this way for so long. That when I feel \"okay\" I double question it. Especially since I still feel depressed just not depressed, depressed.",
    "all the time. like i'm not sure if i have depression or not.",
    "YES. Like, \u201cHow dare you be depressed?? You go to school and work, in a relationship and your own place. You do things like grocery shop and turn your assignments in on time and see friends. You are not depressed!!\u201d When, in fact, you\u2019re just a high functioning depressed person.",
    "Totally... I honestly doubt that I'm depressed at all, considering how much worse other's have it compared to me. But then other's tell me I probably have depression to some extent... I don't know, but I feel like I don't deserve the attention or care since my \"depression\" doesn't feel real/sincere...",
    "Very relatable",
    "100%... I feel bad about being depressed because I don\u2019t feel like I have good enough reasons to be depressed.",
    "I find it comes in waves, so when i feel normal, i immediately doubt myself...even though every piece of evidence shows i clearly have OCD/Depression/Anxiety.",
    "I don't know if is related but... I'm suicidal and like 1 year ago I was very bad but has been a long time (too many months) I'm not thinking about suicide. But I'm struggling with strong avolition, amotivation and apathy. I can't feel sad, cry or think about suicide anymore. It can back, of course, but it comes in moments I think. I know that being apathetic isn't good but is better than being sad.",
    "Same thing happens with my bipolar. I see a lot of people mentioning something similar",
    "Yup",
    "All the fucking time",
    "Yes, I feel this constantly.",
    "Holy shit, yes. I always think \"there are people out there who have a much, much worse life\" and it invalidates my depression constantly, thus making it worse, starting the cycle over again. And over again.",
    "yep all the time it's an odd feeling and sometimes I almost feel happy",
    "I struggle with validating my depression as well, and will often think of how much worse others have it. I am trying to come to terms with the fact that we all experience our pain in different ways, and as a result of different experiences. Just because you may not have the same experiences as someone whose depression you find \u201cvalid\u201d, does not mean that your battle with depression isn\u2019t just as valid. It\u2019s easy to say that without ever believing the words, but keep repeating that anyways. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing, and I hope after reading through these comments you don\u2019t feel as isolated with what you\u2019re experiencing. <3",
    "Yes.  A lot of times it makes me feel like im faking it.  And it even convinces me somdtimes that i am.  But i do know how depressed i am no matter what",
    "Yessss omg. Because I'm on medication and have \"high functioning\" (what does that even mean?) depression, I feel like I should be happier because other people \"have it worse.\" Ugh, that sucks. You're not alone \u2764\ufe0f",
    "I always remind myself that other people have it worse and relate to this as if my depression wasn\u2019t valid or bad enough to be considered that",
    "Every time I\u2019m under a ketamine infusion ( maxed-credit cards yay.) I have a clear moment where I think to myself :\u201d did I really need this? What the hell am I doing here\u201d \n\nThe infusions usually end with me weeping cuz I rather just not feel so many negative emotions and be dead. \n\nDepression will make you doubtful, destroy your self worth, and second guess every decision you make... even a diagnostic by a doctor is not enough to feel sure about anything.",
    "Ohhhhh yes. Definitely. It can tell you a lot of lies and make you believe things that are far from true. It does a lot. What's important is to try to make yourself believe that your feelings are valid. They are. Plus, there's various levels of depression. One person's depression is completely different from another person's depression",
    "This used to happen to me before. But now i ignore my depression. I'm always running away from everything.",
    "I\u2019m pretty sure feeling like you aren\u2019t out of it enough to count is actually a requirement for having a mental illness. I ran an advocacy group in college and every single person said that starting out, often defensively.",
    "Yes absolutely.",
    "The feeling of being over dramatic. Like \"kids are starving in Africa or something and I'm bitching about my feelings\" kinda mentality. I get that a lot. I think a lot of people do.",
    "I was thinking about this a few days ago I got to the point of asking myself a stupid question of am I depressed enough to be an advocate of mental health? I'm even anxious in the most stupid things my mind has be thinking of ever.",
    "ALL. THE. FUCKING. TIME.",
    "I did have that feeling once. But somehow, a little voice told me that I was fooling myself and the depression was getting into \u201csurvival\u201d mode. That is how it works. That is how it crawls all over you. \nDon\u2019t listen to it and keep the fight!!!!",
    "Used to.\nBut i think that's because people have romanticized depression too much in media.\nMaybe ask your psychologist or psychiatrist to talk about depression with you, so he/she could explain how depression actually goes into it's work.",
    "Yeah, my best friend has really bad depression and compared to her my depression is nothing. It made me not seek help for a while because I wasn\u2019t that bad but now I\u2019m getting the help I need",
    "Yes It happened to most of people. Depression is a state of mind where people locked their feelings n emotions knowingly or unknowingly that's why after few days we stop recognising our feelings. We named our depression as our laziness or frustration. Suppressing feelings and emotions leads to panic attacks too so never do that to yourself instead go to a place where you can shred few tears alone.",
    "So after reading all comments here it looks like for people as such it's better not to listen to other depressed people?",
    "All the goddamn time",
    "what if its true i feel as though my problems arent big enough or like im not suicidal and hence im not depressed",
    "You are depressed, the one you are talking to is mo much depressed, \n\nConvo ending both of you in \"who's-more-depressed-contest\". \n\nPffffft",
    "Totally. Had a few days like it last week. Felt like I shouldn't be like this that I am not depressed. That I don't have anything to be depressed about (domestic abuse in a past relationship that still haunts me) and that my husband must think I am just lazy and faking it (I work, I do house work, care for my pets, do shopping) and all that sort of crap. It is really difficult to deal with at times.\n\nEdit: Also this reminded me to take my meds and order new my repeat prescription so thanks \ud83d\ude0a",
    "Yup! I always told myself that if i wasnt hospitalized/inpatient i must be faking it in some weird way. That being said I have always believed people around me were depressed without that, just not ME. And then when I was hospitalized I just thought the doctors were incompetent and played fine so they would let me go.",
    "Yep I have this a lot too",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Sence I'm a woman my dad brought up that it could just be pms, so I  stoped taking my meds for a while after that. Boy whas that a horrible move.",
    "Hate people just say cheer up. Cheer up your head la. I meant like the mood is not controllable,  you want me to fake it is it?! Faking it makes me even more tired.",
    "Yes. Im always just like \"do i ACTUALLY have depression or am I just a lazy ass?\"",
    "I go through this so much that I end up just really confused at the end of the day because a) I question myself if what I'm feeling is real or is it just because b) I got so used to feeling down and depressed for a couple of years that it just became my second skin. It's so difficult but then tere will be days that you're just so sure that you're in this cycle again.",
    "Totally",
    "I think it\u2019s common, especially in developed countries. \nI often feel guilty for suffering from depression/anxiety/mental health issues which are triggered by trivial everyday things. The fact that my substance abuse (mostly pot) triggered my issues makes feel worse, since it\u2019s my fault. \n\nMy body is healthy, and I\u2019m a young man. The world, however, is full of people who suffer greatly. People who are in poverty, debilitated people, people who\u2019ve been orphaned, or lost children, or who\u2019ve been seriously wounded, or lost their loved ones to disease, wars or suicide.",
    "I can agree with this. I've just become too comfortable with my depression. I've been suffering from a major depressive issue for so long its normal now. It has gotten worse in the last month and I'm missing more work and sleeping more but can't afford to get any help. That and I really just don't care anymore. Trying to come to peace with it and I'm close.",
    "Yes! It\u2019s me right now",
    "Yes. I just started taking antidepressants after learning I\u2019ve been depressed for years without noticing. I thought \u201cI\u2019m just sad, it will pass\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m just going through a rough time, it\u2019s life\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m hypersensitive\u201d, insomnia, panicking attacks, lack of energy (which I would think it was just me being lazy)... everything was pointing I was depressed, I just didn\u2019t acknowledged it. \n\nMy life is completely different now, way better, Prozac saved me and I took it for granted for so many years refusing to take any meds, thinking \u201cit is normal to be sad sometimes\u201d.",
    "Most certainly",
    "I was so depressed I was stuck in bed for days at a time. Finally got an appointment with a psychiatrist and almost cancelled because I wasn't *that* depressed and there was someone who needed it more than me.",
    "All the time.",
    "I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one who feels this.",
    "100%mate I look at other people and just wander how I'm depressed when I've got such a good life",
    "Ahhh, depression and overthinking, the perfect combo.",
    "Yes. Currently in a partial hospitalization program where I\u2019m in a group setting all day with others who have issues similar to mine & my messed up brain keeps hearing these other peoples stories and how bad things got for them & then I start feeling bad/guilty that I maybe don\u2019t belong there and someone else needs it more than myself and bleh. The truth is, even though I am maybe more functioning than others are able to be through their illness, I\u2019m still sick and still need help. Depression is depression/mental illness is mental illness and it doesn\u2019t always look the same from person to person.",
    "Definitely I always compare myself to other people. I feel well it\u2019s not that bad and I\u2019ll just bootstrap my way through it. I feel I\u2019m depressed and lethargic but well it\u2019s not that bad I still shower and go to work so how depressed am I really? Im an adult I\u2019ll be ok. Then I distract myself with a bunch of bs.",
    "Lol yes. It's so sadly common. Yall know you're sick, but when compared to others, suddenly you're the one who seem fine. It just suppress the need to reach out.",
    "all the fucking time. i know i'm depressed but i feel like im not depressed enough to get help. i feel like there's people who need the help more than i do and that's why i keep it all to myself.",
    "I relate to this so much. It just makes me feel so much worse about myself. I know so many other people have it worse, but for some reason I can\u2019t cope with my relatively \u201ceasy\u201d life",
    "Yep, happens to me all the time. I\u2019ll be sad as can be and then talk to another depressed person and it always seems like their \u201creasons\u201d for being depressed are so much more valid than my own. Then I feel even worse about myself because I can\u2019t even cope with my comparatively small problems.",
    "I\u2019m like this but I dont know why.",
    "Depression is depression no matter the cause. It all fucking sucks",
    "Feel that way lately.. That's why I'm telling everyone I'm fine when I truly need someone to talk to. But I don't want them to say: \"ough this shit again?\" \"just tell me even if you told me 1000 times\" \"people die unwillingly and you think of killing yourself?\" etc",
    "[deleted]",
    "Yes. Even my depression is invalidated.",
    "Same only with school instead of work. Must be difficult getting through a day, but I'm really hoping for you to get better. Hope you're doing fine mate\ud83d\udc4b\n(Am I allowed to call you mate cause you're older than me.... Sorry if it bothered you\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude05)",
    "It\u2019s amazing how people thinks that actually helps me. Like I get you are trying to get me to look at me from a new perspective but I will take it as \u201cyou are such a garbage person for being depressed\u201d",
    "This is a tough one for me, I got diagnosed with CFS, chronic fatigue syndrome, because I\u2019m tired all the time no matter how much sleep I get. It definitely mirrors classic signs of depression. \n\nIt\u2019s very possible I have no clue how much I\u2019m depressed because I keep telling everyone and myself I\u2019m not depressed.",
    "This is so sad, alexa play despacito",
    "Hey, 'Who's more depressed contest' rhymes\nBut yeah, that happens a lot...",
    "Definitely this. Failing a test gets me into full depression mode but then I see others who are drug-addicted or are homeless and it makes me so sick of myself for being depressed about trivial stuff.",
    "Same, its like when i see other people looking pushing away their depression I can't apply that same feeling to myself.",
    "Right, like I don't want to ever make something like that a contest.",
    "Was that pun intended or...?",
    "They either try and help out but aren't experienced with mental illnesses or straight up just try to shit on me. Usually it's the latter.",
    "I edited so as to not trigger anyone!",
    "Keep it, it was good",

    "Oh good, it\u2019s not just me. I\u2019m floored when people like me, think I\u2019m funny, enjoy my interests. Hell, I\u2019m married and I\u2019m still questioning if this is some long con joke and I\u2019m going to find out I\u2019m as boring as I\u2019ve feared",
    "All the time",
    "I honestly don't know why people like me. But it does come as a shock when it seems like people actually want to talk with me",
    "Yeah.  I mean, I'm still in the woods so to speak, as I tend to isolate for extended periods of time and don't really have any solid relationships.  I've never heard this from anyone, but it's on my mind a lot.  Like, idk if you can relate to this, and I can't articulate why exactly right now, but when you reflect for long enough as to why exactly *you* are boring, and more boring than anyone else, eventually you reach the conclusion that it's not really founded in reason and can only seem to be explained as an illusion of your mind as a repressed fear of rejection.  Your unconscious will go to extreme lengths to protect yourself from ostracism (think evolutionarily; you're fighting for survival), but it is so strong your assumptions as to where you 'stand' are so pessimistic that it is really difficult to challenge them.\n\nIn essence, it really isn't very rational: you look at people and try to deduce what exactly it is that would make *you* want to hang out with *them*, and then try to figure out why it is what it is you're missing, and it's quite difficult.  But until you can change it with long-term habituation, it's really a very powerful illusion, not least because even if you can disprove it, you can't prove another alternative and you're left in the dark so to speak.  You really have to just take a leap of faith with these things and be prepared to fail.",
    "Yep! Tonight in particular I'm struggling to trust that my friends actually like me. I feel like an outsider in all my relationships, even the close ones. Sometimes even my marriage.",
    "I am actually the opposite of you all, I'm too boring and doesn't socialize most of the time. Maybe that's why other people don't like to hangout with me. I think I have an awful personality and people can see it hence they avoid me. I hate being alone too much.",
    "Yes",
    "Struggled with this quite a bit lately, think it causes me to freeze and not really take any initiative with people I haven't already known closely for a long time. Like the whole perspective I have in my head is \"sure, if you really want to\" about things like hanging out and talking etc, but in my head I also don't want to bother them with if I were to ask the same thing. I know for sure that its in my head at least 90% of the time, recently especially i was told over and over how it was great that I'm around and given heaps of compliments etc. \n\nHonestly my over worrying might be costing me someone who seems pretty great because I've been feeling pretty frantic over it. They showed a lot of interest in me, but because I'm way too hypervigilant that they would eventually realize how much I suck it feels excruciating trying to take the initiative lol. I'm actually very comfortable when the other person sets the pace but its clear enough this person is waiting for me to. Realistically I know that any of what I worry about probably wouldn't happen if I could get over these beliefs. Its the beliefs that are holding me back. Maybe its time I start doing CBT journals and worksheets again and working on someone of these thoughts and feelings that have been popping up since I started being social again",
    "All the time! And the irony is that I am a social worker, specifically a youth crisis counselor. I'm told all the time that I am a great guy, and I have no enemies. I just think I'm a bit weird, and my interests aren't really \"shareable\" (True Crime) So if somebody *really* gets to know me I always think \"Okay, they are still here...\"\n\nYou're not alone. Also... as an aside. The older you get the more difficult it is to find friends. So do it while you're in your 20s or in college/university. All my friends I've known for 10 to 15 years. The rest are acquaintances.",
    "Yeah, but ultimately people like who they like. They like who they feel connected to. Sometimes you can\u2019t really explain that connection, except that we tend to like people who we feel familiar to in some sense. Or someone that has something we feel we lack. Also, people\u2019s perception of us are a lot different than our perception of ourselves. Be easy on yourself!",
    "Yeah, it rarely happens. Most people just want me to feed them, but when they actually take it interest in me, its awesome. Super rare, but, whatever.",
    "Oh yes.  Ruined a few relationships for sure.  Self love comes first!  Nothing else replaces it",
    "Yeah that happens. My guard goes up if someone is too friendly. As a kid some adults hurt me, so there is a general social anxiety of people in general. I am fine with animals.  But   It takes me awhile to get used to new people.  I was quite ashamed to be enjoying social distancing",
    "Yes all the time.. My first thought when someone o wants to spend time with me is never 'oh they must like me' it's 'they must be bored/trying to get away from their house/have nothing else to do'. Comes back to self worth. I don't think much of myself so I don't understand why other people might.",
    "Oh man, hit the mark. And when I act confused, I swear I'm not being ungrateful I'm genuinely shocked.",
    "Omg yess and if someone likes hanging out with me i get paranoid and think that they're making fun of me",
    "I would think they're lying",
    "i dont even believe them",
    "I don\u2019t know a lot of people, or talk to many people. I have a kind of issue where potential dates have only ever really liked me for my looks and wanted sex. Whenever someone tells me they actually like me as a person, I feel like they\u2019re lying or want something from me. As a result, I don\u2019t have very many friends or go out ever",

    "All my life.",
    "Same.",
    "Same, as someone who\u2019s friends turned out to be a bunch of assholes and didn\u2019t like me I have trust issues and hat who I am. So when someone say they like my company I can\u2019t describe how happy it makes me.",
    "Very unexpected and kinda feels undeserved when it happens to me.",
    "Yeah, and even knowing it's all grounded in (lack of) self-worth doesn't make it easier to get out of. I had a time where I'd worked myself up to having confidence in me, but then a bad breakup and a lot of personal loss sent me spiraling back down really hard and I haven't really been able to get back since. It's really hard to trust or understand when people say they like me or miss me or want to spend time with me.",

    "I honestly don\u2019t believe it.",

    "Sometimes I think they must be lying.",
    "Yup, all the time.",
    "Yes sis. Same.",
    "Atleast we wont have the fake people. Coz we hard to like. So if theres a connection\u2014 it is a good one.",
    "Yes. Paired with being extremely uncomfortable with compliments bc I think they're either pitying me or I've duped them into liking me.",
    "I feel the same. Even the people I date I still don't think it is possible for them to like me as a person.",
    "Yeah I feel exactly the same way.",
    "Not necessarily, but when they remember me after years and have good memories, etc. then that\u2019s what surprises me. I feel like no one would ever remember me but I guess i have left a mark on a few people.",
    "Oh definitely. And the compliments I get aren\u2019t usually the ones I expect. For example: \u201cI admire the way you interact with people\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re very poetic\u201d. I think it\u2019s because I grew up with such strong pressure to succeed academically that in the past that was all I presented as and my real best qualities were mostly hidden. So now whenever I get those types of compliments I feel happy but it also feels kinda unreal.",
    "I go through this all the time. Its so bad, to a point where i have lost so many potential friends. My brain cant understand why someone would want to be around me. I feel as if people are just gonna leave me in the end so i end up pushing them away.i guess its because i hate myself and i have not even discovered who i am yet.",
    "Nah it\u2019s not just you mate, lots of people are like this from what I\u2019ve seen from my anecdotal opinion experiences it tends to stem from childhood bullying because childhood bullying makes you insecure and then this causes change in personality this ostracises you and then most people don\u2019t like your company and when someone does it\u2019s a shock to you but I\u2019m no doctor so I can\u2019t say for sure this is the cause but I can say for sure i for one has the exact same feeling as you on this",
    "Definitely. I was bullied all through childhood at school and had an abusive father besides. I play roleplaying games, and it took years for me to get other catastrophising and overthinking things from little things, and thinking people hated me. Even now, deep down, I find it hard to believe people like me and only put up with me.",
    "Well, yeah. Im not too good of a guy, im not perfect, nor am i talented but im just relieved to know that someone appreciates me for who i am.",
    "Yeah it was even to the point where my friends would be making plans and I'd be like, can I come? And later I'd be freaking out about them only hanging out with me because I asked and they didn't want to say no.",
    "People don\u2019t tell me that so I wouldn\u2019t know",
    "Yes, definitely! What I still remember is a situation where somebody said to me you're not like the others, you're quite different but I like that. she's my best friend till today",
    "I went from a very small group of friends to a large pool of them based off of who all wanted my attention often and people who considered me a friend. I never saw what anyone sees in me and you can call it low self confidence but I was just really curious. People would laugh at most of my responses and think I\u2019m funny but I never see what\u2019s funny in what I say unless I\u2019m blatantly making a joke. And when I try to make a joke it\u2019s somehow less funny than my actual personality. I\u2019m a sucker for bad jokes what can I say? \n\nAlso, I never really considered myself outgoing but somehow people think I am, and I do talk to a lot of people but only because I either have to or they want to talk to me and I don\u2019t mind. Even now I look at my friends and ask myself why they like me cause I\u2019m a complete mess.",
    "Hasn't happened to me yet...",
    "Yep my coworkers would be my example. Brought tears to my eyes when they specifically invited just me out for drinks and board games night outside of work \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI didn't think it was possible for people to actually like me enough to want to hang with me given the difficulties of making new friends at a certain age in life. Makes me cherish them and love them that much more.",
    "Yup. I just want to know what they're after. Like... You cant possibly like me, so what do you REALLY want?",
    "Yes! I totally feel that way all the time.  I figure they just don't know me well enough yet and will eventually not like me.  I mean, I don't like me how could they??",
    "Yes! And it's so bad that when someone suggests we should \"get together and hangout one day\" I  instantly think it's a setup. Like they're kidding or suggesting it out of pity. Or for any malicious intent. Lmao. It's a real issue for me.",
    "My trust issues have so many levels that i don't even trust myself at this point.",
    "Always. Specially when someone I barely know wants to hang out with me. Makes me uncomfortable and super nervous",
    "Yup. I didn\u2019t believe it for the longest time. Partly because my parents were very critical of me growing up. They were those typical- if you get a 99% on a test, they\u2019d only ask why you lost 1% without saying anything good.\n\nIt was only in college and after that I realized everyone else I meet in society likes me and I stopped being shell shocked about it.\n\nI hope you reach a place of realizing that you\u2019re awesome!",
    "I used to be confused by it. I had a narrative built in my head about how I felt others see me. Unlearning that and learning to recognize that what others think of me is beyond my control, helped me out. \n\nIt's still a pleasant surprise when others say they like my company, but I think that feeling says more about my feelings on enjoying my own company myself than it does about them liking my company.",
    "I once had a girl tell me I was actually starting to be fun once, after knowing her for years. I had been on antidepressants and they were working wonders for me and I understand she meant I was confident and she enjoyed that but she said it in such a rude way and to this day it irks me.",
    "Its not just you. I thought the sane thing exept that i think people think im anoying and just don't want to leave me because then ill be alone.",
    "I was genuinely surprised and in disbelief when a friend texted me recently because he wondered why I have been quiet these days. I thought he didn't even notice when I didn't text, or didn't want to talk to me again.",
    "I just assume that they would be lying.",
    "Yes I do. Mainly because I am quiet/shy if I don't know someone super well and people assume I'm just being a bitch or I think I'm better than them. So yes if someone likes I do get extremely surprised.",
    "non stop",
    "I always assume they're lying or joking and self depreciate until they don't like me.",
    "Can\u2019t relate because nobody likes me",
    "Yup. Part of me keeps searching for an ulterior motive.",
    "Yep. Also often get nauseous in response to praise. It is what it is.",
    "Absolutely. I find myself to be annoying and when my bf told me he likes my personality and thinks im adorable when i get flustered and always calms me down when i get anxiety which is the root of why i think im annoying because i let my thoughts take over too easily nd its a work in progress.",
    "I tend to not believe people when they tell me they like me, I usually just think they\u2019re trying to be polite. Logically I realize it\u2019s probably just in my head, but it\u2019s hard to get past those thoughts.",
    "Yes!! I understand. Here are something I think will help which I\u2019ve been implementing in my life.(if you want advice!)\n1. The main thing is lack of self love. Instead of forcing yourself to love yourself(physically, mentally, anyway) learn to accept it. An example is, I was insecure of having a small chest. I made a list of pros and instead of hating I would say \u201cI accept my body and what it\u2019s done for me to keep me alive and healthy.\u201d On days I felt v insecure. Of course I still have days where I\u2019m insecure but for the most part, I have come to terms and accept my small chest. It feels incredibly freeing to accept something about yourself and not care rather than forcing yourself to love it and feel like you\u2019re lying.\n2. Look at maslow's hierarchy of needs\n[maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=maslow's%20hierarchy%20of%20needs&iax=images&ia=images&iai=http://www.nosmokeandmirrors.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Maslows-Hierarchy-of-Needs.jpg) Having a solid foundation/targeting the root is always a solid step as it will make everything else go much easier. So essentially make sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep, water, food, if you\u2019re in an unhealthy environment try your best to ignore the toxicity(easier said than done).\n3. Make a list of 10 things you love about yourself. Then keep adding, try to get as many as you can. When I first made my list, it took me 10 minutes to think of 1 then I cried for three hours because I couldn\u2019t think of anything else. It took me two hours after that to get to 10. Ive been working on it since and I am now up to 90! It can be something as small as \u201cI love/like that I love cookies\u201d or \u201cwhen I sit like L from deathnote\u201d \u201cbirthmark on my cheek\u201d \u201chow I\u2019m fully attentive to people when I listen\u201d or \u201chow I enjoy gardening\u201d\n4. Whenever you see a quality in someone you like or dislike, write it down. For the things that you like, see how you can exhibit those qualities more. For the things you dislike, see if you yourself have those qualities and if so, try to find the root of them and talk to yourself like you\u2019re talking to your child self dealing with those issues.\n\nI\u2019m obviously no professional, these are things that I\u2019ve implementing into my life that have been helping!",
    "Yes! I always ask people why they want to hangout or talk to me. I get surprised if someone genuinely wants to be my friend. You\u2019re not alone in this thought! We need to change our way of thinking and realize we matter and are important in this world.",
    "Constantly.",
    "Had a drunk friend casually give me a big hug and tell me something along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re such a good friend...just a good person...I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re in my life\u201d. Ended up making me tear up but I was also fairly tipsy at the time lol. \n\nHe and I don\u2019t talk that often but regardless of true sincerity it\u2019s still something I think about and hold on to on days that I feel like ending it. I hope he really meant what he said.",

I think that's pretty normal for most people.\n\nBut when I'm really low, I can barely will myself to do it. It's so much fucking effort to even think about.

    "Do you shower in the morning? I'm more of an evening person because right after, feeling all refreshed, you can just jump to bed and collapse. I only shower in the morning when I need my hair to look good and/or style it. \n\nThat way rather than a chore its more of something that feels good right after I collapse on the bed. Most of the time I don't even dry my hair (long) and idc. \n\nFor teeth sometimes I've just used mouthwash. Better than nothing if that's all you can handle. \n\nDay by day. Maybe one day you can brush your teeth, next day just \"refresh yourself\" on the sink, and so on. That works. Keep doing at least one, and praise yourself for it. Day by day.",
    "Edited to add: I also keep personal hygiene items in my car and find that using them when I\u2019m driving or waiting (I tend to arrive to places early or take work breaks in my car to listen to audiobooks) works well sometimes. Like floss picks, face wipes, tweezers, q-tips, hairbrush, or some eyeliner, chapstick, and perfume. \n\n\nDry shampoo. Use a teeth whitening gel sometimes (it makes your mouth feel so clean). Don\u2019t worry about shaving (a lot of times I just get the bottom 3\u201d of each leg and my armpits every couple of days. Shower super fast and just hit the high spots with the same shampoo you washed your hair with. Progress not perfection. Before you get in set out what clothes you\u2019re going to put on when you get out. Brush your teeth in the shower. \n\nAlso, I recently bought two travel bidets. One for soapy water and one for rinse water. Sometimes I skip the shower all together and just spray off with both of these on the toilet, then quickly wipe my armpits with a baby wipe and apply deodorant. Lightly spray my hair with brown tinted dry shampoo and hairspray and toss it in a high bun.",
    "Oh absolutely. I had/ve depression really early, so I was showing this sign of lack of self-hygiene like, midway through middle school. My mom always got really frustrated with me when I told her \"I forgot to shower this morning\" or \"I forgot to brush my teeth\". It wasn't that I didn't want to, I just physically couldn't. I forgot and had total apathy with the idea of it. She'd always punish me for it anyway, grounding me for weeks, always making it really awkward to tell people who made me feel good that I was grounded for not taking care of myself.\n\nNow I'm older and have received therapy, but on bad days I \\*feel\\* this. I struggle dude, and you're absolutely not alone.",

I'm so sorry things are so hard for you right now. I know what you're going through, and though your experience is entirely your own, just know you're not alone. Hygiene is often the last thing on my list when I'm going through a depressive episode. It it really hard! Don't beat yourself up for it. The ONE thing I've found that helps me with the teeth brushing, is that I finally invested in a sonic powered toothbrush that has a two-minute timer to help you be thorough. It's really helped me a lot. I don't know if it would help you, but it couldn't hurt if it's something you can afford to do.",

    "I feel this so hard, I'm sorry buddy. I've collected a handful of tips and tricks over the years, it's still a chore but anything to make things slightly easier, right?\n\n- dry shampoo is your best friend. I barely even wash my hair any more, my depressive episodes are near constant. Dry shampoo is a godsend.\n- baby wipes! If showering is too much, just giving your face, pits and ass a quick wipe down makes you feel so much better. If you don't have wipes, a facecloth will do the job just as well.\n- sit down in the shower if you have to. It's surprisingly helpful, especially when you're exhausted just by standing.\n- you can just stand in there and let the water run over you for a bit, and if that's all you can manage that's fine. Sometimes it's less about getting clean and more about feeling better. \n- febreeze your clothes, you'll feel less smelly and it freshens up the room a bit too.\n- mouthwash is easier than brushing if you don't have the energy. Alternatively, you can just brush with water, as it's more about breaking up the plaque than anything.\n- I have short hair so I don't know much about styles, but if you can do a bun they tend to look good no matter how messy.\n- possibly the most difficult of all: try not to beat yourself up about it. I still struggle to no end with bullying myself relentlessly over this kind of thing, but I promise it's ok. You're trying your best, and that's what matters.",

Takes me an hour or more to go from waking up to getting out of bed, and then I get lightheaded as soon as I\u2019m upright (meds), so my energy is zapped by the time I have to wash up for the morning. I try to breathe through every action so it feels a little less physically exhausting. \n\nIt\u2019s been maybe 5 months for me? I feel a tiny bit better than when my episode was at its worst though.

Food caked over every inch of my apartment (I eat at my desk, typically with no plates or utensils), crevices behind garbage are disgusting, floor is gross, toilet/shower is gross, just...everything.\n\nI'd feel self-conscious enough that I'd \"pre-clean\" before the cleaner came, which totally defeats the purpose? :/\n\nI also live in a teeny tiny studio (400 sqft), and I'm worried the cleaner would judge me for hiring them for such a small space.",

    "I see, thanks for sharing. At least it\u2019s really a step in the right direction, even if just a small one at this juncture; you\u2019re one step closer to getting the professional help that you feel you need. Maybe seeing a therapist or counsellor in the meantime might help a bit? \n\nFirst times are scary, but just know that you have an entire community to support you. It\u2019s good to have a strong in-person support system built from friends and family too. They\u2019re the only reason I\u2019m still here tbh. \n\nWishing you all the best for your mental health journey. I hope you find yourself in a better mental space soon! x",
    "I just experienced a truly horrific hallucination, and had 3 really big panic attacks one right after the other. My mental health sucks and my brain is sabotaging me. I am seeing a therapist, she's the one who finally convinced my mom that I do have several mental illnesses and that helped me have my mom get me a doctors appointment.",
    "Good that you\u2019re seeing a therapist! Still, I\u2019m really sorry that you\u2019re experiencing the hallucinations and panic attacks (especially the rolling ones, those fucking suck). Depression itself is already tough enough. \n\nHang in there, alright? You\u2019re so close to getting the meds that\u2019ll help you out for sure. My inbox is open in the meantime if the hallucinations and panic attacks get too much and you need to vent. Take care, remember to take deep breaths, and try to drink lots of water! x",

    "Hey OP, I relate to this. First of all, I am so glad this happened. Thank you for stopping when your kitty stole the rope. When I was a teenager, my cat saved my life by being my only safe, reliable family member who showed me unconditional love. This included unique (uncommon behavior) and creative demonstrations of reassuring or distracting attention when I was making plans or self harming. Please let your cat be that for you too. I am sending good energy your way. Also, who\u2019s to say he/she didn\u2019t have a better (maybe not full) awareness of what was going on? Either way you are loved unconditionally by at least one being, and there are more out there who will do the same. Please keep hanging on.",
    "He loves you. That means you have someone depending on you. Hold on to that. Even as little as it might seem. I'm sure he would be lost without you. \n\nI've had to focus on this with my pets. They need me. So therefore I'm going to stay for a while. I'm glad you're still here. Keep strong. If you ever need to talk, shoot me a message! \n\nI know how hard it is. \u2764",
    "I grew up with dogs and was never much of a cat person. I thought they were kind of cold and selfish.\n\nMy daughter adopted a male 1 yr old kitty about 6 years ago. That did nothing to change my mind. He didn\u2019t want you to touch him, only came around for food, and was kind of a jerk.\n\nBut he did change the last couple of years. Started to like being petted. A lot more sociable.\n\nBut the remarkable thing was, when I was sad, he would come over and nudge me with his little nose, as if trying to distract me. When I was crying, he would kind of nest up in the crook of my arm and stay until I stopped.\n\nIt kind of blew my mind how much empathy I could feel from him. My daughter moved away a couple months ago and took him with her. I miss him so much.\n\nWhat your cat did was no accident. They know. You are important to them. And that\u2019s a gift, no matter who it comes from.",
    "Your cat voted. He says stay, so stay a little longer, see if you can change that suicidal storm you are in.",
    "What a good boy! I'm really happy you're still here and I'm 100% sure that he is too \u2764\ufe0f \n\nFor a long time, the only reason I didn't kill myself was that I couldn't do that to my cat. We live alone just her and I and the thought of the distress that would leave her (no food, no water, no human she trusts) honestly kept me alive for a good two months. \nThey make a bigger difference than they'll ever know. They deserve all the treats and all the pets.",
    "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re still here, and your sweet cat is too! Hope you are starting to feel a bit better. Take care of yourself",

I had no clue he would help my depression as much as he did.\ud83d\udc36\n\nNow we have four dogs.\ud83e\udd23",
    "So the real question is whether the cat was trying to be an asshole at the time or not.",
    "There was a story here on reddit of a guy that was looking out his third or fourth story window, high up enough to be fatal, and he was in the headspace that he was about to do it. Then his cat rubs up against his leg and purrs and it snapped him out of it and he came back to reality, realizing all he has. One of the comments was \"He gave you one of his nine lives\" and it actually did make me cry.\n\nEdit: oh! Oh my God! Please listen to a song called \"Plea From a Cat Named Virtute\", it's by the band The Weakerthans and it's so good. It's from the perspective of a cat with a depressed owner. It goes:\n\n\"Why don't you ever want to play?\n\nI'm tired of this piece of string\n\nYou sleep as much as I do now\n\nAnd you don't eat much of anything\n\nI don't know who you're talking to\n\nI made a search through every room\n\nBut all I found was dust that moved\n\nAnd shadows of the afternoon\n\nAnd listen, about those bitter songs you sing?\n\nThey're not helping anything\n\nThey won't make you strong\n\nAll you ever want to do is drink and watch TV\n\nAnd frankly that thing doesn't really interest me\n\nI swear I'm going to bite you hard\n\nAnd taste your tinny blood\n\nIf you don't stop the self-defeating\n\nLies you've been repeating\n\nSince the day you brought me home\n\nI know you're strong\"",
    "I think pets are really good for us. When I'm depressed and want to give up and just lay in bed and quit my job and all that other stuff, I remember that I have cats to support. They need their mom to get out of bed to take care of them and work so they can eat.",

    "Honestly my cats are the only reason I'm still here. My baby Orion is literally my shadow. She follows me everywhere and cuddles me every chance she gets. I think about what would happen to them if I killed myself and I decide to stay another day. \n\nCats are amazing and a good motivation to stay.",

My mothers friend her son hung himself in the garage, he is now a vegetable, alive he can see everything, hear everything but he cant move, he cant go to the bathroom by himself, he cant feed himself. If you attempt to hang yourself theres no guarantee you'll die you could end up worse off. I attempted suicide with pills. I died, had a near death experience and was given a choice to live or stay in the void or what I think is purgatory. I chose to live and went towards the light. I'm here now and I spend alot of time on reddit trying to comfort others who want to self harm. I'm here if you need to talk to someone please dont be afraid to reach out. You are special and whether you believe in God or not I believe what happened was a miracle. Your cat is amazing. I dont believe in coincidences everything happens for a reason.",

    "I know that every time I've come back home after fucking myself on drugs, doing something reckless or deciding I don't want to hurt myself my cat appears soon after and I remember why I got to stick around and take care of myself.\n\nIts strange because it's never in the middle of my crisis, always immediately after I've made my choice. It feels almost as though she's letting me make up my mind up first so she won't make me feel guilty if I want to leave, but once I decide I want to stay she appears and reminds me she's here and loves me.",

I'm so glad that you have your kitty. I know my cats are truly my support, I just can't even imagine leaving them. \n\nWhen I'm feeling suicidal I tell myself that I dont want to end my life, i want to end my pain and I find something that makes me feel better even if it's only for a bit. I color, I watch my favorite show, and I spend time with my cats because I know they love me and need me.\n\nI'm so sorry you're feeling this way. I know there's nothing I can say to fix the way you're feeling but I hope this makes you feel a little less alone.",

I've dogs at home that brighten my day and last year when I felt suicidal we found a kitten on the side of the road, we ended up keeping him and called him Marley.

He\u2019s sick and twisted but no where in this does he deserve pity for taking the innocence and sense of safety and trust from children. He honestly deserves worse than what he\u2019s getting in my opinion. And once he\u2019s in prison and other inmates find out he\u2019s not only a child molester but a rapist too he\u2019s gonna know and understand exactly how it feels to never feel safe, not trust anyone and feel violated in one of the worst ways possible.

    "You understand that when someone hurts you so strongly like that, that causes people to hate you beyond forgiveness, right? Because essentially, you\u2019ve scarred the person and they have to go through loads of support to be okay again. I totally get your point. If we don\u2019t want him to rape another person, then we must encourage mental help for him. If you just feed him more violence, potentially also rape, and not do anything about his horniness, then he\u2019s just going to come out worse and not as a changed, functioning member of society. You most definitely have a point. People should try to understand, but at the same time, much of the hate towards him is justified.",

Whatever she does now, nothing will change the way that person lives. It will just change the way SHE lives. Why would you put yourself in a prison of hate, when you can finally just be free, and happy, now that your burden disappeared? I am not SURPRISED by the fact that she is still hating him, but I am not justifying her.

I told her about my anxiety/ depression, broke down in tears and asked if i could take a sick day.

    "While on the topic of suicide a brilliant quote from David Wallace:\n\"The so-called \u2018psychotically depressed\u2019 person who tries to kill herself doesn\u2019t do so out of quote \u2018hopelessness\u2019 or any abstract conviction that life\u2019s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise.\n\nMake no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump. Not really. You\u2019d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\"\n\n--David Foster Wallace",

    "No it's not shameful to be on meds.  But the problem arises when people think meds are capable of doing the work for them.  Meds do help a bit.  But that doesn't mean they help with anything besides just stabilization.  The real work is comes from the person themselves with life changes, therapy, keeping good relationships and changing or leaving bad ones, processing and healing from trauma, sleep schedule, meaningful activity, pursuing dreams and aspirations, processing and recovering from social anxiety, etc.  Meds don't do any of that for a person.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I see as a mental health advocate is a very scary thing in the world where people are led to believe that meds will automatically cure their suffering.  And they don't work that way.  So when the discussions all focus on med compliance and ignore the work that has to be done, people don't get better no matter how much medication they take.   And that can make people feel really hopeless when they have been led to believe that meds do more than they do.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yes, people can benefit from meds and shouldn't internalize shame about it.

    "My dad is a shamer. Also a large part of the reason I have mental illness diagnoses. Fuck the people who shame you for it. And fuck the people who try and tell you not to take medication. It\u2019s your choice. Your life. If you want to take a few pills to live a better version of your life, anyone judging can get fucked.",
    "I\u2019ve never thought of medication as indication that those who take are lesser of, quite the opposite to me medication means they\u2019re getting better or getting help. I\u2019m also a firm believer that medication isn\u2019t a solution but a bandaid to the solution while figuring out how to get there. Would I ever start meds? Absolutely. If I get to the point where I need some help I will, but I will also try my very best to get safely off of them again once I started them and make a safe \u201creturn\u201d.\n\nI think it\u2019s a very stigmatized topic and I think it\u2019s one of the many topics that people are afraid to discuss, perhaps because of how people might think according to OP\u2019s experiences.\n\nThere\u2019s something weird about how all of the above sounds but I can\u2019t figure it out so sorry for my english, it\u2019s not my first language.",
    ">dammit I\u2019m just as victorious\n\nYes you are. \n\n\n>choosing medication being made to look like a regrettable choice.\n\nI've found the opposite to be just as common. It's my right to refuse medication when offered. Medication isnt a complete solution on it's own, but is beneficial alongside therapy. If I want therapy on it's own without the help of medication, then I shouldn't be made to feel like I'm being criticised for exercising my right.\n\nIt's irritating how some mental health services try and throw medication at a problem and treat therapy like more of an after thought.

One day you may even be able to walk without the crutches. Medication is not a sign of weakness, it is a sign of strength from someone accepting help.",
    "A lot of the time I\u2019ve found that people who shit on medication use other more unhealthy ways to cope, don\u2019t give up or lose hope you\u2019re doing great \ud83d\udda4",

    "I\u2019m right there with you! I watched my parents deteriorate from long term prescriptions of pain killers for chronic issues. I have always been afraid to be on medication. I am now two months in and although I\u2019m not where I want to be, I\u2019m doing better than I was. I\u2019m 30 and I\u2019ve been trying to manage my mental health issues my entire life on my own. I\u2019ve learned I\u2019m incapable and need help, and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m now see a psychiatrist, on medication, and seeking therapy.. and that\u2019s OK!",
    "It took me a looooooong time to admit I needed something to help with my anxiety and I am SO glad I got on something because it has helped SO much. It\u2019s definitely a nuanced thing with mental health. A diagnosis is already so stigmatized and to have to take medication to manage it is seen as even worse. It\u2019s so dumb. That\u2019s like saying I shouldn\u2019t have to take medicine for my allergies. I should just be able to manage it without.",

    "I think it's as simple as taking a pain killer for a headache and just as natural. I am dealing with depression and have people around me who are supportive and encouraging but sometimes it's just not enough. Though I can't take anti-depressants due to certain medical problems I am certain that if I could have, I definitely would have. Why wouldn't I want to be better? Sometimes it's wise and better to not fight it all alone you know.\n\nAnd considering you have kids who depend on you, your health be it physical or mental is important. I agree with you a 100% you are not a loser to choose yours and your family's well being.",
    "It's extremely ignorant for anybody to view a person that has chosen the route of taking medication as being less than victorious.

Almost as if to say because of that you shouldn\u2019t go on meds. I don\u2019t mind people making the choice for themselves- I just don\u2019t want them castigating me over mine.",

    "Oh that is SO spot on. That\u2019s it exactly.",
    "I hear you, and I\u2019m definitely not suggesting a person should depend on meds alone, but I feel like the stigma is more anti meds than it is pro bettering oneself. I tried \u201cbettering myself\u201d without the meds and that didn\u2019t exactly go well for me as I ended up in hospital. So for me and a suspect a great deal of people the meds are quite the game changer.",

One of the best things I ever heard when I was questioning if I needed treatment was \u201cthis isn\u2019t a race to the bottom; and you need to take care of you\u201d. There\u2019s -always- going to be someone in worse shape; we can\u2019t use that as a metric for getting ourselves help. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re going to see someone, I truly hope you open yourself up to all of the tools there are for healing. Reading what you wrote I can see your very warranted for going to get help. You\u2019ve had to deal with a lot and don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.",

I\u2019m no doctor or smart person, I don\u2019t know why people take whatever kinds of medication they take so I suppose I should rather say \u201cI hope it\u2019s a band-aid and not a solution\u201d?

    "\"Popping pills\" alone rarely solves the issue.  (Depending on what the issue actually is)\n\nHowever, many people find that medication gets them to a place where they can do the rest of the work.

    "I, too, am addicted to endorphins. High-five, buddy!\n\nIt sounds like you need to take baby steps to a more wholesome lifestyle. Start off just working out, and in your spare time just rest and relax. Then slowly slowly add new activities to your schedule. The trick is to slowly taper up on activities you know would be better for you.",
    "What an outstanding thought process. \n\nTruly, you should be proud of yourself. Think about this: despite your back pain, despite how horrible you felt on THIS day, you stood at the bell. Even though it felt impossible, you got up, you went through the motions, and you tried today. I'm proud of you.\n\nBut do you know what's even better? The ending. The fact that you realize that you need to change; now THAT'S where it resonates. That's the concept that will start to change you. The guilt you feel knowing that you could have done better is there to HELP YOU change. Listen to it, but don't hold onto it. There's no need. Accept that you have the potential to feel happy, to live with good health, and to be satisfied when your head hits the pillow. It will happen.\n\nYou know what to do, and you know it will be difficult. But the reason you feel this way is because you deserve better. I'm so sorry that you have to deal with back pain, and I can't imagine the difficulty that comes from the pain meds. I do know just like so many others that you can get through this, and it sounds like you know it too. Just take that first baby step, whatever it may be. A day without alcohol, a nice mile jog, a walk, eating clean for a meal, whatever. Get after it.\n\nTrust me, we all like easy things, and yes, life can be dreadfully hard sometimes. But the harder you try at the beginning with those little victories, the easier the routine gets, the happier you become.   \n\n\nI know it doesn't feel like it, but if you sublimate the pain you felt today and use it make tomorrow better, then today was a victory. \n\nI believe in you, and thank you so much for having the courage to post this. It helps others, whether you know it or not. \n\nShoot me a message if you need any more support!!",
    "Hey there, just wanted to say I understand what it's like. Trying to be mentally stable can be exhausting... And I'm often sick of putting in so much effort and not getting much out of it. You're not alone.",
    "So true. Had to workout 2-3 times a day last year. COVID shut all the studio gyms down and I gave up running now feels like a fat shit the whole time.",
    "Hey, just a reminder, you don't need to perform perfectly. I think we may be similar. Do you feel like dropping when you can't make yourself a whole healthy meal? And you don't even start doing it because you know it's not going to be \"good enough\"? That's some kind of procrastination type, but hear this, you're so aware you have to do the right thing, - but know you may not do it perfectly - and you don't do it at all. Because is better not doing it at all than dissapoiting yourself for performing it poorly, right? Lemme free you from that guilt. Maybe you didn't eat healthy all day, but you made yourself some fruit with yogurt and oats and juice, and ate a good dinner. Half good, right? But it's enough, tomorrow maybe you could eat a healthy breakfast and then got low on energy and then just ate doritos. But it's fine, keep trying. The next day you cooked for three days, ate good breakfast and you didn't ate late. That's perfect ! Maybe it wasn't the fanciest meal, who cares? You're surviving, you're getting better, perfect performance can go to shit. Be proud of everything you do.\n\nDid 10 minutes of work out, couldnt move at all, got tired inmeadiatly, maybe I made that excercise wrong. WHO CARES? It's much better than nothing at all. Your body learns, it accomodates, you become more awake, your breathing gets stronger, next day you did twenty minutes with some music that keept you motivated, your body is in the floor, your heart aches, you breathing is heavier, it might be painful, but it reminds you that you're alive, it's amazing you can feel all of these little tingles in your body, right? Feel yourself, you own this.\n\nForgive yourself, accept your depression, move on, slowly, fail, fail again, try again, get reminded you're alive, that little moment of blessing was worth all the effort. Then try again, those little moments keep accumulating, then everything feels like it makes you aware you're alive, you don't even have to try, or overthinking it too much, and even reaching this point, you may fail again, but it's ok ! You're human and trying and you have every right to keep trying. You forgave yourself and accepted yourself and you can keep doing it forever, it's all worth these few seconds of chills in your body that make you feel like being alive is a blessing and existing is euphoric as it is! You WILL feel it again , just keep trying !!!!",
    "I'm bitter because I'm putting in a fuck ton of effort and it just looks like I'm lazy. Like I'm trying really hard and that comes across as me doing the bare minimum. Two weeks ago for two days I just had normal energy. Like when I went to walk my dog, I decided to make the walk longer, AND we went to the park and had a long walk then. It made me realize how low energy I am all the time and I'm so so bitter.",
    "Yeah.. whenever I try to be a normal, functioning human being I get so burnt out in, at most, a week (if I'm lucky), to the point where I just can't do it anymore and do anything to numb myself. Why does everything tire me out so much? It's ridiculous. People tell me just to force myself to do things, but I literally cant. If I try to force myself, I dissociate, have a mental breakdown, and my brain shuts off. When I'm past that point, it's like telling a lame man to walk. Lately I've been getting better, but it's still not enough and I'm scared I'll fall back down to where I was again. It's like dangling off the edge, one small mistake and I fall off the hypothetical ravine I climbed myself out of.",

    "Yes. So much yes. I'm neurodivergent so I wasn't born with the natural ability to be 'normal' like everyone else. My day was similar to yours. Missed my workout (first time in nearly 5 weeks), was unproductive, binged crap food and watched TV. There's always tomorrow, as I've said so many times throughout my life. Sigh.",
    "Mate, without exercise, I would be unable to work and low functioning. I find getting up each day for work extremely difficult. Yet, I\u2019ve continued to do it, somehow, for 3 years now. I think the key has been exercise, working 4 days, and gaming (believe it or not). I\u2019ve been on heavy medications but quite frankly I\u2019ve found exercise to be more effective and given research is continually evolving, I do not feel comfortable taking them LT. I also suffer from anxiety (although not diagnosed) and I often feel like I am dying. Therefore, LT med usage never feels good for my mind and body. \nExercise also reduces my chronic pain I\u2019ve endured for 9 years.",

It\u2019ll play out in unexpected ways. \n\nYou did a lot today. A lot! I look at your post and I see the pocket of amazing things you did for yourself today. It\u2019s a practice. You don\u2019t have to keep at it everyday. Everyday you keep at it you get better. Your life gets better. \n\nIt\u2019ll all play out in unexpected ways.

The road to wellness is hard, long, but at one point you will feel that \\_every step matters\\_. Just as you'll feel at one point that none of the steps matter. It's a road with different types of pavements. Some are slippery. Some are smooth. Some have an incredible incline that makes it hard. Some are easy-going descending-the-mountain type.

I know they all need me to put effort into to help though, and whilst i\u2019ve gotten better at making some healthy choices I have a way to go on the consistency front. Especially on shutting down negative habits and mindsets when I fee them coming on. \n\nOn the subject of solvable problems - the back pain stems from me having a mild genetic condition that can be managed very easily with regular exercise. By building up my core and back muscles they can act as a support and I would be fine. Genius here has never done that though - and it took me tearing something on one side of my spine, collapsing to the floor and being paralysed from pain for 5 days (no sitting, standing, walking etc) to start taking action. I find it almost funny because it\u2019s almost made me immune to regular pain, my migraines don\u2019t faze me anywhere near as much.

    "I really hear you on this one. I've struggled with being extremely lethargic and low energy, taking long naps throughout the day, and then having bursts of energy every week or two where I tried to get my life together and be a normal, healthy person. I remember the ravine-- it usually felt like I was sitting or lying next to it, not about to fall, but the danger was always present. \n It impacted my life a lot: I slept through classes, didn't eat when I should have because I didn't want to go through the process of making myself a meal, and skipped social events because I was tired. I eventually talked to my doctor about it, who recommended some blood tests for things like blood cell count and thiamine levels. When they all came back negative, it was a relief in some ways, but good to know that I could fix it with my mental health. \n\nThe best advice I can give is to reframe the question-- feeling like the only way to get better is to buck up and force yourself to be healthy can be really counterproductive. It just adds on guilt, and creates a \"healthy\" vs \"unhealthy\" dichotomy. \n\nThe way I got myself through that was reconnecting with my sense of joy and wonder about the world. Cultivating gratitude for the smallest things does wonders-- it's like a muscle, the more you think that way the more natural and authentic it is. I cut out naps-- now I just have a quiet moment to myself instead of falling asleep. Consider your feelings of guilt, and try to disconnect from that. I like to aim for consistency rather than perfection, so I don't feel bad if I didn't do my laundry, exercise, study, look at my finances all in one day. Just one of those things once a week is a success!",

    "14 pple -.-",
    "Yes, and if it seems like an insurmountable task, your brain will automatically give up. Why would you logically try if you've convinced yourself being mentally healthy is near impossible and takes so much effort? You're doing the SANE thing to just ignore that line of thinking and drink vodka instead. \n\nBut obviously, that's not what we want out of life. So you have to convince yourself it's not impossible. You don't reach a point of being perfect when it comes to life. Thinking you will and it's just a matter of working hard enough to get there can lead to some toxic patterns. It did for me for a loooong time. \n\nWhat helped were those baby steps, yes, but I had to shower myself with praise when I accomplished one small thing (like, taking out the trash. And not just tying it and letting it sit there, but actually taking it down and moving the can to the curb). And then I SMOTHER myself with love and praise and encouragement. I did it! I am so freaking proud of myself!! Yes!! I finished a task!!\n\nAnd then I did another small task. And another. Etc. \nBut I slid back into patterns, which is often, I try not to let negativity grab me but instead say, it's ok, I have been tired today, what can I do instead? And slowly, your mind remembers these positive patterns and naturally goes there instead of the negative.\n\nThe lack of energy, that feeling of sand, definitely sounds like depression. Energy is the currency of mental health. If you can find a way to trick your brain to get that energy back, you are on the right track. \n\nGood luck my friend. I'm proud of you. And you should be too.\n\nEdits: stupid autocorrect",

You are not alone, and the reason you probably asked the question is because like me you were insecure at one point in time about it.\n\nIt could be: \nStress and cortisol due to everyday life. With a person that has mental illness it exacerbates the symptoms of stress. Everyone gets stressed, but few tend to understand that mental illness actually makes some people actually seem straight forgetful, disorganized, irritated, tired and can also give people coordination issues. \n\nI have some weird chronic fatigue issues with depression and it makes everything terrible. People have actually told me about my memory issues and it makes me very insecure. Now people can run their mouths all day about advice, but really the best thing you can do is to slowly recover through multiple ways:\n\n- Sleep health is very important.\n- Vitamins and nutrition\n- Lower stress and meditate\n- Exercise\n- Don't isolate yourself, this can actually have drastic effects on your functioning.\n- Find soft hobbies or companies, maybe pets to occupy or stimulate your mind\n- Self compassion\n\nNow worst is that you don't feel anything, but it can only help. And yes I understand when people say these things are easy, especially to someone with severe anxiety, it appears somewhat disingenuous... *Did it work for them?* I would say to myself. Just don't think about it like that, you know what's best for you... With help that is... Kind of a paradox...

I flunked out of college, altho at that time I was very distracted and trying to escape a bad home life situation.  \n\nI too am exhausted, in a constant brain fog from my dead end job, and dead inside. \n\nYou aren't alone friend :(",
    "I have been struggling with depression, anxiety and anger issues for ~3 years now and had very similar problems , the thing that truly helped me was working out until I couldn't move anymore and a doobie afterwards, with time it gradually gotten better and now I have periods that last up to a whole week where im not feeling like total shit. Just be patient and work on yourself my friend :). If you want to talk about anything feel free to hmu.",
    "Yes. At the grocery store, sometimes I'll wander off and forget what I wanted. My wife tells me she can tell from my wife that the thought is leaving my head, as if I were Dori from *Finding Nemo.* \n\nMy wife is very patient with me, God bless her. <3",

    ">Does anyone else feel this way? How did you overcome it?\n\nYes, I can't fucking stand it. I'm literally trying everything. Proper rest, proper diet, fish oil, choline, probiotics, exercise, etc. *Nothing* seems to help. I feel brain fog..sometimes brain dead almost every single day. It feels as though I've lost access to parts of my brain..as though the synapses aren't firing and my brain is shutting down.",
    "My memory was brilliant up until i hit 15/16. I'm 25 now, and struggle doing my job (it requires a good memory). I only remember snippets of events such as holidays, or conversations so it feels like they've never actually happened. Had an ex who took advantage of that and made me go quite literally mad.\n\nI wouldn't worry, I know it's annoying and makes you feel bad about yourself but this is you, and you're not the only one. \n\nWriting helps me a tonne. Write everything down. Dates, keep a diary (write in this at the end of every day, or if you have the time at that moment that you want to remember). We have a book of silly things that people have said at work dating back to 2015, and i guarantee you, no one would remember half of them if it wasn't in the book.",

But still, I've experienced your symptoms in the context of mental illness and sedatives fixed them, which means they were probably *not* stupidity, as Ativan does not increase IQ.\n\nDepression and anxiety have a sometimes drastic effect on cognition, especially if you've been untreated for a long time. Just remember that feeling \"stupid\" requires a degree of self-awareness that you probably wouldn't have if you were actually losing intelligence.",

Always forgetting things and I hate saying \"oh shit I forgot\" all the time coz I don't want people thinking it's just a poor excuse for not doing something.\nI try to be in the habit of writing tasks down that I need to do, but it doesn't help when I forget I need to put some on the list *facepalm*",

    "Yes!! I definitely have noticed a change in my own cognition, but I believe mine was caused by the medications I was prescribed at the time, especially Tegretol.

Do you have a routine you follow everyday?",

    "god i totally get this, half the time i think my brain is in rest mode and i completely forget things i'm meant to be doing, things i have done, things i've been trying to say and it's sometimes quite upsetting but i guess sometimes you have to just deal with the cards you're dealt",
    "Yes",
    "That's completely normal as your mind is focused on other things that are important to you. It doesn't matter if those things are actually important, but they are important to you and part of your anxiety disorder. \n\nThe only way to snap out of it is to start seeing what is REALLY important in your life. \n\nLately, I have been working from home due to corona and I have been sluggish. I exercise daily and until I workout, I am tired all day and foggy. I have never in my life been one to nap, but I have taken more naps in the last six months than in my entire life. \n\nA couple weeks ago I was debating taking a three hour trip to a certain place to get a certain food and breathe some fresh air. I took a friday off to go an do it, but on thursday, I woke up and thought I should go after work instead. \n\nINSTANTLY, I was filled with energy and purpose! I jumped out of bed, got all of my work done  early, and hit the highway! \n\nMy sluggishness was gone because I decided to make it go away because I decided to do something I wanted to do. \n\nYou can do the same thing. \n\nIn addition, you have incentive to do it because if you are letting people down, you need to talk to yourself and get some energy and purpose going. There is nothing wrong with being out of it at some times of the day, but when you're behind the metaphorical wheel of your car, you need to remind yourself to snap out of it and drive straight.",
    "It can make you appear to be dumb or forgetful to other people.  They see you pause to think about something and think \"Oh, they must be confused\".  No, they're not confused they're just considering ten thousand other possibilities and issues that other people never have to deal with.",

    "This is a part of depression",

If I'm lucky, I'll remember after many prompts\n\nIt makes me feel like a terrible partner.",

It s really frustrating.\n\nI made my peace with it, i really don't think i can change this, i am who i am, not everybody needs to be a genius",
    "Hi fellow MDD/GAD sufferer /s \n\nI'm somewhat in recession regarding my depression I think (not sure how long it has to be to be called that way, but after years I've had more than a month very stable) I get very frustrated because I know I was sharper and faster-thinking before depression set in, and finding myself forgetting stuff in a minute makes me feel really stupid. Careful with that though, because it creates a vicious cycle.\n\nAnyway. Yes the meds and the depression cause cognitive issues. Bah, the meds tend to make you drowsy and spaced out as they are meant to calm you down. I've relatively recently have read a few studies in which they track that even after achieving remission the cognitive symptoms can linger for many months after, but it's not something doctors seem to address very much in practice as the first priority is get you into remission. \n\nI spoke about it with my doctor and he says yes it is true, but once your stressors are better managed there can be slow improvement. I've been using one of those apps that have puzzles and activities for brains but I haven't used it consistently enough to give you a review. That said now that I haven't been depressed for a while I'm proud to say I picked up the first fiction book in nearly a decade  (the Blade Runner novel) and finished it in three days or so like it was the most normal thing and I was able to read normal without getting spaced out. So something got better now that my depression symptoms are at bay. I do get worse when anxious too, so I take it very seriously to stay away from known stressors that aren't necessary and make sure I have me time and stuff like that. \n\nHope that gives you some optimism.",
    "I suffered from anxiety and I felt like my mind was racing so much during the day it was too tired to do anything productive. Learning to calm myself down helped. I learned mindfulness and CBT which seemed to help me quiet my mind. \n\nOne of my friends who had depression said she became very forgetful. She found that getting out of the house and going for a walk (anything that got the blood flowing and oxygen to the brain) helped her a bit.",
    "Hey,\n\nFirst of all, I'm sorry you feel that way. Yes, I know how you feel. I suffer from anxiety and mild depression. I have gone through some tough things lately and they have a taken a toll on my mental health. But my mantra is that I won't let my trauma define my life for me. In other words, I do not want to give it power over my life. I'm not saying you can ever forget it but you can come to terms with where you are able to live life without it impacting your life in a negative way. It's easier said than done for sure. I was constantly thinking about what other people think of me but I read somewhere that I should live the life I want, not how other's think I should. Perhaps at the end of my life, I want to look back and be happy with the life I chose to live. Other people might have their opinions but only you know whats best for you. Remember, you are the one who has to deal with the consequences and/or benefits of the decisions you make. So make them based on what you think is best for you, not what other people think. I used to hold back from things (that aren't bad at all tbh, like for honest if I want to wear makeup) because I thought other people would judge me. But tbh I am happy when I wear makeup and if other people have a problem with it, it says something about them and not me. I know that's a silly example, possibly but hopefully you get my point. I am not telling you that you should not listen to other people but become more aware of the difference between genuine advice and unnecessary judgement. I did not notice that I got more forgetful and felt more stupid. To help with my forgetfulness, I got a planner that I used to plan my weeks and that I looked at everyday. It had a checklist in it. It honestly transformed my life. It's a small thing but it made a big difference. I was able to manage my time better. Another thing that helped me was to incorporate yoga and/or exercise at a particular time. Having a daily routine made things come naturally to me. I would totally recommend you set a daily routine that you don't have to follow rigidly the first few times but eventually you get the hang of it. As for feeling stupid, those are just FEELINGS. I read a book by a therapist and she made this point that feeling uncomfortable is normal to humans. The only difference between those who are confident and insecure is how they interpret this feeling. Insecure people see it as a FACT to their lack of intelligence and skills while confident people realize that it's just a feeling. She recommended that you make a list of all the accomplishments you've made in your life. They are evidence and a testament to your achievements and intelligence. Sometimes when our mental health is not in the right place, our minds give more weight to the negative things in our life despite all the tremendous amount of positive things in our life. Also, she recommended that whenever you get a negative thought or feeling, just actively talk yourself through it and tell yourself that it's okay to feel like this but it does not say anything about your intelligence. If I did bad on a presentation, instead of \"I did bad because I'm stupid\" I should think like \"My presentation could have been better but it's okay. I still gave it my best I could. I'll try to do better next time\". I also journal a lot especially when I'm stressed out. The number of times I have cried because of a thought and then I journal and everything becomes so clear. I don't know how to explain it but it's like I'm freewriting my thoughts on paper and as I keep doing so, things become clearer and clearer. I hope this helps you. If you want to talk more about this, I can try to give you more suggestions but these are the ones that have helped me the most. Also, know that you are not the only one who feels like this. Ironically, knowing that makes us feel less insecure about ourselves.",

    "Yes, depression, fear, and trauma all affect cognitive functioning, clarity, reaction time, lots of things. \nCheck out Neurofeedback, though! They're having great results with it. It's cutting edge. \nThis is my friend, Sue Bahnan, talking about neurofeedback, and how it works.

    "Hey! I had saved this to come back to it! I kind of have had lapses in memory. I once posted a link in a group, and asked my friend to see it. A few days later, I asked him if he had seen the link I posted months ago according to me, and I posted the song again, and he goes, \"You posted this last Friday\", and I'm like \"What?\" :P :P :P I was super depressed then, and I wasn't keeping track of time. I really think our minds are too tired to keep track of things that aren't necessary according to it! My memory is fine btw. It still didn't remember when I posted that. I think memory exercises might help! There was a time when we used to remember phone numbers, now we kind of don't. We are getting a little lazy, we should also do stuff to improve our memory!   \n\n\nAs for you, you're perfect the way you are! You're amazing, and that doesn't diminish based on the ability of others to see it! :)  \n\n\nYou said that you were depressed!  I really think you need to take a break, try to understand what you want from life! Try to connect to yourself. Try to understand why you feel what you feel! It might be scary at first, but just because it's hard and scary doesn't mean it's bad, you know? It's like untying a knot! Life's about being happy! To be happy, you should get to a state in which you are not depressed. To get there, you need to ask your mind questions, why you feel what you feel, things like that!  \n\n\nIf your job is toxic to you, you should quit! If there are people that affect you in a bad way, you're allowed to not want them in your life! Don't do anything you don't like doing! All of these things affect you in a bad way!  \n\n\nConnect to yourself! Ask yourself what you want from life! :) Life's about being happy, and doing what you love! Life's about having fun, and spending time with your loved ones! Life's about finding out what you're passionate about, and doing it! You're one in seven billion! You're perfect the way you are! Everyone's great at something, and everyone can be great at something if they do what it takes! Everyone is a genius in their own way! If you haven't found out what you're passionate about, keep looking! Here's the thing, people love watching passionate people do their thing! Whether it's streaming games, or singing, or whatever! Do something you want to do in life! Follow your passion! Follow your heart! If you do what you're passionate about, everyday, when you wake up, you'll embrace the day instead of going \"Ugh, I have to work today\", you know? It might not be sunshine and rainbows all the time, but it's something you want!  \n\n\nYou're perfect the way you are! We should always accept ourselves for who we are. If there's something you don't like about yourself, you can change it, but only for yourself, not for others. Others should accept you for who you are! You should accept others for who they are! Always be yourself!   \n\n\nIt's important to understand that there are things out of our control, and one shouldn't worry about things that we can't do anything about! What we do have control over, we can do something, so we shouldn't worry as much!  \n\n\nI really wish this helped! :) Everything's going to be okay! :) I'm here if you ever need someone to talk to! :)",

    "this is definitely interesting but I\u2019ve certainly never heard of something like depression causing actual irreversible damage to your brain. id understand if while you were depressed your brain would be in a way damaged and that perhaps it would cause short term damage, but permanent damage to the extent of causing possibly severe dementia after only a few decades is a pretty massive claim. do you have a source for all this info? this possibly is quite awkward for me because ive never ever been comfortable with taking any medication or antidepressants, has nothing to do with any sort of disliking of antidepressants in general but simply because ive always had a bit of a phobia about taking pills if I\u2019m not 100% certain of what they\u2019re doing to my body. i don\u2019t have bipolar but ive had chronic depression since i was 13 and im 21 now.",

However, there are so many different kinds of medications and everyone responds to them differently, so you'll definitely want to talk to a professional who can evaluate you.

The more I learn about how great this place is, the greater this place seems.\n\nWhat I've learned is that there's good and bad stuff happening all the time, but the sum of our reality is truly amazing. The case of our existence, organisms composed by elements from space through 13.8 billion years, are still evolving and expanding.\n\nI sometimes imagine a \"timelapse\" of earth and the moon next too each other through time. Suddenly a small metal container exits earths atmosphere, headed for the moon with apes inside clicking buttons. For the fun of it, imagine our universe is some kind of simulation done by intelligence that returns to check the results, saying \"What the hell is going on here...\"\n\nThe nature of our reality\u2014a complex mathematical equation of particles\u2014has gotten to the point where it asks questions about its existence. Asking questions like \"Where do we come from? What are the rules of the universe?\" is like a program realizing it's a program, not knowing how it started and where and when it ends.\n\nI don't think our world is depressing at all.

I'm betting we are much safer today than those who lived 100.000 years ago, 2.000 years ago and 200 years ago. We are never gonna be satisfied with our reality, and that is also one of the biggest reasons we have consistently pushed forward since the beginning of our existence.\n\nI'll let our ego spill out here; humans seems to be the most promising organism in this galaxy to understand what the hell is going on.

    "What could help you is reading up on Existentialism. Nobody is responsible for your own happiness, you Build it yourself!

Read up on existentialism or the other schools of thought.\n\nWhat might help you is to know that whichever way you are thinking - you can change it. How? Well, terribly simple, but not very known - you just practice thinking 'out loud' (in your head) to yourself the way you want to think, if you wanna like something - maybe your first reaction is to dislike it - but always have a narrative 'out loud' in your head afterwards that corrects it or is the way you wanna feel about it. If you hate somebody, but know they are not bad, every time you hate on them - always talk yourself out of it and remind yourself of what you truly believe, look at the good qualities you like in them, think of how hard something might be on them for them to react in a certain way, think of how they just might not know better and how it's not really their fault.   \nThat's your structure for everything - whatever you want to be, however you want to think - practice it in your head. After a few weeks you'd notice something amazing - the way you were thinking before will be replaced automatically by the way you tried thinking.\n\nWorks like a charm and works on everything!\n\n(Also works for empathy - if you wanna be more empathetic - practice an inner monologue of what you appreciate in the people you see - after a few weeks - it would be You and it would happen automatically!)\n\nHope this helps!",

All we can do with it is what actions we take. Do we cling to the pain, or do we learn to let it go? \nSocial media shows us what is happening at a VERY concentrated level so it feels like everything is wrong, but really we must pay attention to our surroundings and ourself first and foremost then it won't be so bad. \n\nAs children, we did not know the ways of the world, and as we get older, we see more and it will keep going like that until you find a way to cope with it.

The things you used to believe will get fun for you and the people who do not know will become hilarious in your mind. So try to continue this depression is temporary and will fade away.",

No other species was able to create massive destructive forces like the atomic bomb (even though this isn\u2019t a positive thing, it\u2019s still apart of our human genius and stupidity). Humans to me can\u2019t get anymore interesting. We have histories and stories of great conquerors such as Alexander the Great to philosophers who completely changed western philosophy like Rene Descartes. It\u2019s truly amazing the amount we\u2019ve accomplished good and bad. And even the bad is interesting to me. Concepts like how we began to even form civilizations from ideas like social contract to other ideas. The list goes on and on, looking at societal structures, political groups and movements, colonization, ect. These things may be good and evil but they\u2019re apart of human nature, and understanding the complexity of us is truly fascinating.

When I felt more comfortable in my clothes/body it was easier to go out and I realized that people weren't looking at me nearly as often as it felt like they were. \n\nSome people actually go the opposite direction with clothes/makeup. You could try dressing up in something more outrageous to stand out. It works for some people because even though people are seeing your outer appearance, they're not really seeing you.

Maybe it\u2019s something you can try to do as well. \n\nThinking of you and know that you are not alone.",
    "Yes!!!  I hate going out and to stores where people can see me. I\u2019m so uncomfortable in my skin.",

    "I\u2019ve been like this. Therapy and medication help a lot. Also, limit your time out and build on it. 30 minutes at first then one hour and so on. Surround yourself with people you\u2019re comfortable with. Baby steps. It gets better. Therapy helped me be more confident and not want to feel so invisible and medication helped alleviate my anxiety/depression/panic attacks so that I could go out. Together you literally can become bulletproof and stronger. I wouldn\u2019t suggest one without the other for this.",
    "when i\u2019m feeling especially anxious about being seen i\u2019ll wear sunglasses ( or even tinted glasses ) or a hat\u2014 it makes me feel less vulnerable",
    "I go through phases with this. I've been in depressive states that involved me not wanting to leave my home or only wanting to leave my home at night for a couple months at a time. I'd also feel very anti social during these periods and ignored a lot of friends/family attempts to contact me. \n\nTheres also times I have a milder version of this, in which I'm not necessarily afraid to be seen by people but rather be seen by/running into certain people (when im.not in the mood for chatting). I'm in a mild version of it now, anytime I see certain neighbors outside and they're sitting/facing the direction of my driveway I try to wait a few minutes before going outside (and hope they go inside) or act like im preoccupied with something and dont look in their direction.",
    "I do that. For me, it was diagnosed as agoraphobia from ze PTSD. I hate it and have a hard time describing it to people. Like, I feel like just the air outside is attacking me.\n\nEdit: a word",
    "I had a moment of fear yesterday when I went to Walmart. I was alone and was verbally attacked by a woman. When I defended myself ahe belittled me. Her entire family watching.  I left the situation feeling very sad and insecure.",
    "I had issues with the same thing for a majority of my life. There were so many things I avoided doing- going through drive-thru's, medical or dental appointments, shopping at certain places, movie theaters, large parties or get-togethers. I worked for a large company for many years and the thought of going in the breakroom caused so much anxiety that I avoided it. I remember how rough everything was. Thankfully, my day-to-day life and my ability to do daily activities has improved so much with therapy and the right medication. I still have bad days where I kind of \"hibernate\", but there are more good than bad, thankfully. You're definitely not alone in feeling how you do.",
    "I'm exactly the same! I really struggle to go outside and do things by myself. I'm so used to going outside with my mum and my mum doing things for me when I suddenly had to do things myself I was terrified. I got bullied a lot and left alone by almost everyone for years had developed an extreme distrust in everyday people. I'm so scared someone is going to jump out and attack me or insult me for no reason. Reading Karen stories and stories of people jumping out and verbally attacking for no reason I think reaffirms my fears even though they're fun to read...",
    "I have gone through periods like this before. I dont want to go out in public because I dont want to be seen. I dont want to be judged, i dont want people thinking im ugly, i dont want to be looked at, I dont want to be vulnerable. Like you said, invisible. The only thing in the moment that feels right is to stay hidden away in the protection of your home. For me the extreme of that is tucked away in my room in bed and under the covers. invisible and hidden. What has helped for me when I get into this way of thinking is to remind myself that LITERALLY STRANGERS DO NOT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING IM DOING OR WHAT I LOOK LIKE! Everyone is too involved with themselves to hyperfocus on you. No one is judging when you walk past them, are standing in line at a restaurant, checking out at a store, waiting for an uber, laying under the sun at a park, browsing, shopping, running, eating, laughing, smiling, NONE OF IT!!!! and if someone is, it will be for 3 seconds max and by the next day they will forget about it forever. This is what I tell myself when I start wanting to feel invisible and hide. People are too selfish to judge me. I hope that this helps you in some way. Ive had to tell myself this over and over, but im so glad i did. Its such a small thing but it goes a long way to just say to yourself: \u201cstrangers do not care.\u201d",
    "im the same, esp now being in quarantine for so long the thought of going out terrifies me, and seeing groups of people my own age",
    "ME HECKING TOO",
    "literally always",
    "Yes. This. The whole wearing a mask becoming normal thing is actually good for me. Something to hide behind. Add a hat, and sunglasses during the day and I'm much more comfortable. Even so I only leave my house at night unless absolutely necessary.",
    "For me personally this happens because I'm scared I'll do something embarassing/hurtful/etc. I've recently started making a list of things i think i will do/i think will happen and then cross out the ones that don't. I think it's helping to also ask myself WHY i feel like something bad will happen.",

And although one might assume the lockdown has been good wrt this, it has actually made this fear of going out much worse and made me feel trapped.\nPlus this fear is so difficult to explain to people and i constantly feel so low whenever I try to talk about it.\nSomeone else here suggested taking small excursions outside and building your comfort little by little and I aim to do that.\nI hope you also find a way to overcome this fear because it can't be good for our health overall.\nTake care and stay safe, xx.",

    "it truly affected me back in college its the main reason why i tranferred 3 times in a university the first one is close to my high school building which i saw familiar face then the 2nd one i just kinds give up mid way then  and on 3rd time i went from different location where people dont know me p, i still got bullied someway or the way i felt,  i just endure it. and finally graduated with fair grades.  but prior to that, Whenever im gonna go to school, i end up in computer shop that i dont even. other or walk around far away from my house. its because of people, maybe because of of my past experience in grade school and highschool that got carried on college. then i went to other country for profession, i excelled on my training mid way then alot of thing happen after that, i got into scooter accident, move into new apartment and mu training got slowed down for unknown reason, and my performance drilped down, then next thing you know, i request alot of unreasonble leave of absence. afraid to get expose and be judge by people around me. then they gave me ultimatum, it took me almost 2 year to recover from that slump and finally got my license. And when i back in my country, i became from that person to an outsider who goes to the mall or do anything outside, where i couldnt stay in house inside. because i felt it going to get me crazy again..... Now, my bigget problem is i got anxiety around girls, i cant look them in the eyes directly. i just felt like chicken. maybe thats why i dont have any girlfriend for almost 8 years. no offense they find me as a good looking guy or as they thought would be. but for my side i am so insecure that when i see myself in the mirror, i see so many defects with my face or my body( hands too long, i thought my arms was thin) things those.  \n\nif anyone can give me advice that would be life changing for me indeed.",
    "Have you tried wearing a hat? I started doing this recently at stores and at work and it really helps me feel more invisible.",
    "I\u2019m going through that now. I hate the current state of the world.. I\u2019m a lil fat so I\u2019ve been bullied all my life  & I even get bullied online Somone told me I sound fat and it literally made me want to die... \n\nI was told to stand up for myself... this got me no where but I\u2019m trouble in middle/high school \nWhite lower class sped kid... I\u2019m an easy target even for the teachers. Last couple jobs I\u2019ve had have all been ruined by people pushing me around or egging me on... I just walk away.\nBut I\u2019m stuck in my room afraid to even talk because I\u2019ll say something to offend or creep Somone out. I tried to get help and the therapist was kinda snappy at me because I missed the first appointment due to a Schedualing error. I haven\u2019t went back. I haven\u2019t talked to my doctor Last time they put me on meds that had me hearing voices.  I\u2019m terrified to even talk to my neighbors because they\u2019ll ask me what I do.... my reply is always \u201cjust existing\u201c I wish I wasn\u2019t ...",
    "I\u2019m dealing with this every day. When I do leave the house, I have to take a mild sedative and lately I just try to do very non stressful things. Going hiking where I\u2019m outdoors feels wonderful and like I can escape anytime. I\u2019ve also chosen to go to flower shops, they smell fantastic and feel outdoorsy. You were right when you said you know you need to keep going out, just make it on your terms until you\u2019re more comfortable challenging yourself. I still can\u2019t go to a sit down dinner with friends. I literally just shake and then can\u2019t eat, but I\u2019m working towards it! Good luck and keep trying.",

    "I have anxiety and I feel exactly the way that you described. In my experience, when I exercise and take extra good care of myself (eating well, skin care, stretching every day, exercise, reading) I find that I feel way more confident and capable and the fear of being perceived as horrible becomes more managable because i literally feel less horrible.  \n\n\nEdit: Love to everyone here, hope all of us get a little better all the time.",
    "Well, I think it is ok if you want to be alone but is necesary for your health to try to leave home maybe just to take a walk is very relaxing, you can make the others invisible is ok not to say hi Good Morning to everybody I don't do it always even if it is rude, and you should try btw my neighboor is a person that never leave home is kinda weird the problem is that even if you were invisible you need to leave home to go for food or just to take the trash out or things like that because you need to leave home for basic regular daily activities, so a person that is at home all the time is more weird and we all notice about and is what you and Some others dislike so you need to go outside and maybe just say hi to be more invisible and not be the weird person everybody notice that is hidden maybe because you are introvert but just a little advice not a rule but just a tip if you want to be a little invisible just sayin",
    "This is pretty relatable to me. I hate going outside because of that same reason. I feel like people are staring at me but not in a good way, even if they aren't, and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I used to get so much anxiety during gym class, it was the worst thing. I would feel like crying cause I would feel so scared being around people, especially when the activities began. It was worst when we either had to play volleyball, basketball or just walk around the gym. I would always walk around caus eI didn't have anyone to play with and I'm really shy around people unless they show that they are nice. I don't know why I was so afraid of getting hit by a ball, it literally felt like if I got hit by a ball (which I did multiple times) It would be the worst thing that could happen. I guess I felt like people would laugh at me or that they would be doing it on purpose. I don't really know what might help with these kinds of things but music does help a lot. I would keep my head down a lot but try to keep your head up as much as possible.",
    "I am. I fear other people, I especially fear what they think/say about me - So I get really bad, when I walk past 2 or more people. I fear that  they are whispering about me, point and laugh at me, going to shout snarky comments at me or maybe even get physical at me. It has even come that far, that now I also fear to take public transports, like the bus and train, because I fear what kind of people that are in there. It really sucks since I love being outside. Especially in the nature areas, like the forest, park and beach. Unfortunately in these places a lot of young people get together in big crowds, and drink in the summertime in my town",
    "I can recommend some meditation and practice mindfulness, I used to have panic attacks all the time and then I started to meditate and helped a lot, you need to realize panic attacks and anxiety are generated because of the way your brain has been wired subconsciously by some form of trauma that has happened before, you can unlearn this patterns and re-wire your brain so you can have normal behaviors in any situation you\u2019re in.\nI know you can do it, don\u2019t be afraid anymore, there\u2019s no use to it.",
    "This wearing a mask thing is what I\u2019ve wished for forever. We are all faceless now.",
    "Yeah. I know that I liked to go outside when I was younger, and I'm not sure if I've stopped enjoying it, but nowadays I only go outside when it's necessary to walk my dog or whatever. When I do I wear dark sunglasses, keep my hair in my face, look down at the sidewalk, just try to hide myself overall. If I can avoid going outside at all, I will. I don't like people looking at me. You're not alone. :) I like that it's not weird to wear a mask everywhere now.",
    "This is me! I have to still go to work but thats where I end up having more anxiety and stress. I've had multiple panic attacks in public and at work and had to come back home. When im extremely anxious, I try to go on a small walk with my partner and dogs. Usually we come back within 20-25 minutes.. this usually helps me to not be scared outside.. i hope this was helpful?",
    "I got this way a while back when I started running my own business. I was teaching piano and guitar lessons and basically forgot how to converse with adults in public even though it was something I was so good at before. As an adult now I'd rather not talk to anyone besides those close to me. Itas crazy how anxiety or just lack of \"practice\" can make you so insecure.",
    "Thank you for sharing your own struggles and messaging me. I got nervous when I posted this and I thought I got rid of the post! \ud83d\ude05 but I\u2019m glad It\u2019s still up now! Quarantine was already my lifestyle so nothing changed for me, so I can understand how it felt like a blessing for you. I guess I\u2019ll have to try walking in quiet areas. It still makes me ridiculously nervous even if there are hardly any people around but I also know there is no other way \ud83d\ude43",
    "I\u2019m sorry you had to go through feeling uncomfortable in your skin. I hope you know you are beautiful, and you give yourself worth! If you feel beautiful, you ARE! No one can take that from you! Ahah Awee I really like that idea of the whole doing the opposite and having fun with my outer appearance! Tbh when I wear makeup that does help a bit. For now I may have to make small goals as you did going out once or twice a week or perhaps wear a mask when I do \ud83d\ude0c thank you for messaging me!",
    "I am really sorry you have had to go through this. But just know it\u2019s not \u2018your fault\u2019 your mothers issues are her own and do not have to be yours, and they are also not at the fault of you. You are a human and deserve to be in this world just like anyone else! \nJust think when you see your roommates I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t think terrible things about them, so it\u2019s most likely they don\u2019t mind you at all either! We are human we make sounds! as long as you\u2019re not actively banging and smashing things about normal noises are absolutely fine! None of us live in complete silence! And if they didn\u2019t want to live with other people they could always rent a smaller place to themselves or move out! Your existence isn\u2019t a bother! Your existence matters. You have permission to be comfortable and live. Focus on the human experience and possibilities. I like spinning in the rain, feeling my hair and face get wet jumping bare foot on the grass. It helps me feel alive! Perhaps focus on these things too! :) \nthanks for messing me!",
    "Yes exactly. I guess wearing a mask would be a good step forward. Especially in our current situation wearing a mask is very normal. I got picked on a lot growing up so I think my dear derives from that.",
    "Thank you so much lovely! I also used to have a weird fear of people randomly trying to take me or kidnap me, even if I was with my family. Luckily that has faded now, and it\u2019s mostly just me feeling  uncomfortable in my skin. I\u2019m on antidepressants, but that hasn\u2019t done much for my confidence aha. Ooh pros and cons or going out! That\u2019s a good idea actually! I think I\u2019ll definitely give that a go thank you! \n\nI wish you and your husband well! Thank you for messaging me\ud83d\ude0c",
    "Lol I would literally wear jeans and a sweater whenever I go out, even if it's summer.",
    "Yes it\u2019s a very uncomfortable feeling, and I\u2019m genuinely sorry you also feel that way. Perhaps look through the comments to see if any make you feel better! Someone said about writing a pros and cons list of going out :)",
    "I\u2019m so sorry, it\u2019s definitely a really uncomfortable feeling. Especially since it\u2019s the skin we will be in for the rest of our lives. So I guess we have to put our focus on what we do have or perhaps the physical abilities our bodies allow us to do, the memories we can make, the feelings we can experience. Such as the raindrops from the sky onto our face, running in a field, climbing a tree! Smelling your fav perfume, commenting on someone\u2019s post so they don\u2019t feel alone and you can be heard! Sometimes I try to remind myself of the human experience rather than appearance. You can attract the energy you give out!",
    "I can sympathise with you on this! Quarantine hasn\u2019t changed anything for me either. As someone with depression, anxiety and ADHD, I  don\u2019t have a job I haven\u2019t learnt how to drive yet and I struggle to be productive at home too. I live at home with my family so I don\u2019t even have to go out to get food. So it\u2019s like how do I learn how to live? Someone in the comments said their husband made a pros and cons list to going outside, perhaps that will help us realise why going outside can be more helpful! \nAlso it helps me to try and think of the human experience, making memories, experiencing new things. What our shells allow us to do rather than what they \u2018look like\u2019 easier said than done I know, but a start at the least!",
    "I am on antidepressants, I have been for years. But for some reason my depression is getting bad again. Although I spoke to my doctor and she said it sounds Adhd related, which I am diagnosed with but haven\u2019t received help for yet as I was in anorexia recovery and so I couldn\u2019t have certain meds because they cut the appetite. However I am hoping once I can get the Adhd support it will help with my anxiety and depression as a lot of my issues are derived from my adhd not being helped or treated! Soooo let\u2019s hope for the best in the near future! Thank you for sharing this with me, and I\u2019m super happy that it has personally helped you\u2019 \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f",
    "That\u2019s a good idea to make a start with thank you! I hope one day you\u2019ll be able to leave the house without it and feel comfortable with who you are, you deserve to be seen just like anyone else! But as a step forward I think this will definitely help, thank you so much! :)",
    "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to go through this, but ultimately I\u2019m really happy to hear that it has eased for you. I understand it\u2019s very uncomfortable and not easy, but I\u2019m just glad that the waves of it aren\u2019t always intense! That makes me hopeful for you, perhaps it will be less and less. It also makes me hopeful for the others commenting and myself. \n\nAlthough I\u2019m really sorry the depressive episodes are so tough on you. I\u2019m glad you have friends and family who try to keep in contact, but I hope you find a way to help minimise it. \nThank you for sharing.",

    "I'm sorry you had to go through that. That sounds so scary.",
    "Oh man, I am sorry you had to experience that. It\u2019s such a shame people do things like this. I hope you know that it\u2019s their issue and not yours. I hope you\u2019re able to feel a little better and at ease. I\u2019ve also had many verbal remarks made to me, but we must try to remember it is not our fault, and it\u2019s usually to do with the type of person they are!",
    "I am so happy to hear that your ability to do daily things has improved!! That is wonderful, so especially since it seems like you limited yourself a lot when it came to living your daily life, and honestly it\u2019s such a shame that it disables so much from our life experience. Why should our appearance dictate our experience of life! Frick man, I really gotta work on it! And thank you for sharing your story <3 I hope it keeps improving for you!",
    "Wow this sounds so similar to me, I definitely rely a lot on my mum or my sister when it comes to going out. I get too anxious to do things alone, and yes being bullied does make it harder to trust people as a general. Lol I can\u2019t help but find the Karen stories amusing, but just think no one likes a Karen, and no one thinks Karen\u2019s opinion matters! Karen doesn\u2019t even have a motive she\u2019s just a Karen! But just like this comment section and this community, honestly it really does remind me that there are lots of \u2018good\u2019 people out there too. No one had to comment on this post! You didn\u2019t have to share your story! But you did, because we are in this together! I hope things become better for you, you deserve to be here, and no Karen can take that from you!",
    "Yes this is definitely important to remember! No one thinks about us more than we are thinking about ourselves in relation to being that random stranger in the street. Sometimes I like to look at people and see them as stories, everyone has their individual life, individual experiences and stories. I used to tell myself this too actually. I used to be so lively if I wanted to sing to a song I would, if I wanted to dance in the street I would, if I wanted to spin in the sunlight I would. Because I didn\u2019t see the point of holding myself back from my human experience when I found joy in the little things! That car that passes by does not care, that person who saw me soaking up the sun will probably not even see me again. And most of all, we have permission and we are aloud to live!! We just like them are a human in this world. Thank you for helping try to get back into this mindset! I am happy it has helped you so much, I hope it continues to do so :)",
    "Me too. I'm literally terrified of being around people that are my age.",
    "Yes, I mean not much has changed as I didn\u2019t go out much at all anyway, but quarantine has definitely made me more anxious now. And about teens and people my age. It\u2019s really tough but I\u2019m going to try and focus on the human experience and physical elements, such as the sun light or fresh air, the rain on my skin, the smell of perfume etc. All things that happen that don\u2019t regard our appearance. I hope you are able to overcome this in the near future!",
    "I think the whole mask does help, I mean I need to make myself one but once I do I think I\u2019ll try and brave it! But also I do hope we can get to a stage in life where we are comfortable. Because we deserve to be comfortable when we go out like others \ud83d\udc99",
    "I\u2019m glad that it has been helping you. I think another good thing to do is, even if something does happen, no one will focus on it as much as we do! Think about it you see someone trip over, I personally don\u2019t think Ha ha look at them they suck! I\u2019d just think oops hope they\u2019re okay. And then naturally people forget about it. No one is going to keep thinking about the random person they saw trip. I also like to think of embarrassing moments as funny stories to tell, or adding to the basic adventure of a day!! Ahaha remember that time I did this!! It doesn\u2019t define us as a human it just adds to our experiences:)",
    "I feel this way whenever I go out to walk to church. It's like I want to wear a nice dress for once and I feel very happy in it, since most of my life I've been a tomboy and don't really wear many girly things. But going outside is the problem or when people comment on me weraing a dress. When I walk to my church and people are around I feel so much weight in my shoulders. I start feeling like they are looking at me with bad intentions which really scares me.",
    "I am really glad you can feel less alone! There is a lot going on in the chat and I have also replied to as many people as I can so far and I\u2019m still going, so if it ever helps you to have a read through for different perspectives etc I welcome you to do so :) Also, on your point! I am glad to hear that you make yourself go out even when it\u2019s hard, because the only way is through. But of course it\u2019s okay if some days it is too much, we can just focus on the times we can. I also like to think of it as a human experience which I have mentioned over and over to people on here! Focus on the physical experiences of being out like the wind or the sun, or even the rain, the smells, the way you walk bring the attention to the details of being human! \u263a\ufe0f best of luck to you!",
    "I really hope you\u2019re able to find ways to help you feel more comfortable. You deserve it just like anyone else! I\u2019ve been telling people on here to focus on the human experience, rather than ourselves. For example how the sensations feel around us, the rain on our skin, the bushes we brush past, the smells, what noises? Can we hear the birds, the cars, I wonder where the cars are going... etc! This can help you focus on the earthly experiences rather than bringing attention to feeling anxious about ourselves!",
    "I am really glad that reading the comments on here has helped you, the community is so kind! What I\u2019ve been trying to message people is that i like to think of going out as a human experience. Focus on the physical experiences of being out like the wind or the sun, or even the rain, the smells, the way you walk bring the attention to the details of being human! It can take the focus off of our worries, even if it\u2019s just a little! Thank you, take care too and stay safe, xx",
    "Oh these days try to focus on the human experience, how the air feels, the sounds you can hear. Are there birds, if so what are they doing. Is it warm or cold, where do you feel the breeze? I wonder what that persons story is, where is that car going? Sometimes these thoughts can help distract us a little.",
    "I'm sure you are not ugly. You just need to gain some confidence in yourself like I did. And if people say that you are then don't listen to them.",
    "I just saw a video which was nice,[I don\u2019t feel pretty ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZI35Z6a3LE) I think you should give it a watch it puts being or feeling pretty or ugly into perspective. \n\nI\u2019ve also been telling people on here about trying to focus on the human experience whilst being out to take the edge of our worries. Such as the smells, the sounds we can hear, can we hear birds? What\u2019s the weather like? Am I warm? is the cold air biting my skin? Ooh what does the sky look like today etc... it can help take the edge off sometimes.",
    "Ahah right? Let\u2019s be grateful for our homes :) \nBut also I think it\u2019s nice to be able to go out when we may need to. And focusing on the experience of being human! Such as feeling the breeze, the rain, listening to the birds or traffic etc. \u263a\ufe0f",
    "I also can't be around the opposite gender or look at girls straight in the eyes. I sometimes do the same thing when it comes to looking at myself, I start to compare myself with other girls and my self-esteem gets very low. When you see yourself in the mirror and see things that you don't like, instead of criticising yourself try to see what you could do to change things a bit. If you don't like how your arms are thin, you can try eating a bit more or maybe do some exercises to improve your arms. You can think about the positive things about yourself like how you have long arms, you can reach things that are higher, some people can't do that. Honestly I'm a young adult that's 4'11 with a baby face and it's a bit hard sometimes but I try to find the good things about looking this way. And if you can't find any then try to think about how you are. Are you a nice person, are you honest, do you help people, stuff like that. At least that's what helps me bring my self-esteem a bit more up.",
    "You need more practice.",
    "I totally understand that! This is a silly suggestion, but does it help if you put on a mask and sunglasses? Sometimes I\u2019ll do that so it feels like a disguise and no one can \u2018see\u2019 me. Listening to music can be really distracting, too. Small steps! You got this!",
    "I struggle with the same thing, and my way of coping is I go for drives late at night and just cruise around. Wearing a mask helps with the anxiety. I was judging myself for my desire to be invisible and fear of going out until I saw this post so thanks for sharing, stay strong \ud83d\udc4d you got this, friend, we all do",
    "Thanks so much \u2764\ufe0f ... I definitely feel a lot more confident in myself now. Time and consistency can work wonders!",
    "I feel you, I used to wear a coat in warm and hot weather... it\u2019s not fun \ud83d\ude43 I really hope you\u2019re able to find a way to feel more comfortable in your skin tho! Or perhaps focus on the physical things your body allows you to do! Such as walk or run, smell, hear and perhaps put your focus onto those when you\u2019re out so it can take the focus off of you?",
    "I agree. I sat outside in a hammock yesterday and stared up at the trees and listened to nature. It was so peaceful.",
    "Yeah, that helps too! Do you also have this need to immedeately cover up the emotion of embarassment by \"positive thinking\" and feel angry when you don't feel better? That's one thing that I'm really struggling with and sometimes it just feels like it would be easier if i just let myself feel what i feel. Thanks for the advice, btw :)",
    "I used to be a tomboy too! I felt like I wasn\u2019t allowed to be girly. But you can change your mind everyday if you want. Wearing a pretty dress for church is lovely, and know that whatever others may think the most important thing is that only God can judge you, only God knows your heart and God will also help protect you \ud83d\ude0c to feel more safe, perhaps make sure that you\u2019re walking with a family member or a friend!",
    "This too is a great way of grounding oneself and also being conscious of the outdoors in a more affirming way. I am hoping this will work whenever I feel the same anxieties again. Thank you for your reply! <3",
    "How would you know? And I thought you were gonna leave me alone.",
    "Thank you so much! I actually think that might help me!! Because people can\u2019t see \u2018who I am\u2019 and if I start by going for small walks around my area so I won\u2019t come in contact with many people anyway. Thank you! Time to make a mask ahah",
    "I\u2019m glad that sharing this has helped you! Feel free to read through the comments, perhaps it might help more to see others perspectives too. I can\u2019t drive but I think wearing a mask will definitely help!",
    "I\u2019m genuinely happy to hear that \ud83d\ude0c\u2763\ufe0f",
    "Yeah I'll try that.",
    "Ahh that sounds lovely! I\u2019m super glad to hear that, these are the moments we need to try and focus on. Being grateful for our eyes that see, the ears that hear. Our physical abilities that allow us that moment rather than our physical appearance.",
    "I learnt in therapy that we should allow ourselves to feel what we need, because pushing it away only puts more focus on it. However being aware of the situation and rationalising with ourselves is helpful. For example, I am embarrassed right now that felt awful. However this moment will eventually pass and whoever saw won\u2019t think much of it. If someone else fell I wouldn\u2019t be focusing on it all day. Instead of ahh I\u2019m not going to be embarrassed! I don\u2019t care about what just happened I\u2019m fine. When really that\u2019s not the case. Does that make sense? Feel what you need to feel, but remind yourself it will pass.",
    "I don't really have any friends that I can go to church with and my family stopped going. So I'm the only one that goes. I felt like I wasn't allowed to be girly either or wear dresses because of my brothers. I think I ended up as a tomboy because of them. I remember them making fun of me whenever my mom made me put on a dress when I was little, also whenever she gave me a girls toy my youngest brother wpuld laugh at me and I would end up wanting something \"cool\" like his toy. But now that I'm grown up and I wear a dress I try to leave the house as fast as I can. Sometimes the younger one would see me and wpuld say that I look nice, butbI never end up believing him.",
    "I know that\u2019s easier said than done, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t feel this way at all! I just hope you can feel better in the home you\u2019re in \ud83c\udf31",
    "Yesssss. I agree with this completely. \u2764\ufe0f",
    "I get ya. I'm glad you're going to therapy. That's avery big step! I started my own journey in therapy recently. I hope it's helping you.",
    "I think now that your brothers are older and more mature, they realise. So I am sure he means it when he says you look nice \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\udc95 the most important thing is how you feel, and allowing yourself to enjoy being girly if that\u2019s what you want :)",
    "Hopefully onen day we won't have to feel this way anymore and we could be able to go outside comfortably. Thanks for your help. It's nice to known I'm not the only one doing this. XD",

It made me cry, actually, and I am having a shitty day---your kind words have touched me greatly.  \n\n\nI think a lot of the misconceptions about pyromania comes from the fact that it is not common at all (in fact it is exceedingly rare to have a pyromania diagnosis because of the strict criteria, and less than 1% of the entire population of the US has it) and that it is inherently dangerous, just by its nature. Please ask me questions if you aren't sure about what this disorder is and isn't. I don't mind answering sincere queries into my mind and my heart. I have had this since childhood and have lived with it for a long time. Thanks again guys. I appreciate all of you. :)",

    "It's kind of cool (maybe that's the wrong word lol) to have the opportunity to talk with someone who has pyromania. I've never met one before. I'm glad you're getting the support. That shit really makes a difference. :)\n\nI guess the first question to ask is: *\"what is pyromania?\"*\n\nAnd the second: *\"what is pyromania to YOU?\"*\n\nPeople continue to have misconceptions about well-documented disorders like anxiety and depression. I can only assume we have WILD misconceptions about rare ones like pyromania.\n\n**BONUS THIRD QUESTION:** How do you feel about fire puns?",

    "[deleted]",
    "Lmao who hurt you?",
    "Idk if pyromania falls under psychopathy (probably not) but let me tell you, not everyone in those groups are bad. There are some that do act on their thoughts, but a lot of them actually don't. \n\nYes, they like fire, but some can satisfy it with just lighting a candle and stare at that. Or they just don't satisfy their need to see fire because they know it's wrong to burn things.\n\nSame for psychopaths btw. Yes, they don't feel empathy but that doesn't make them killers. A lot of (rich) people are psychopaths and sociopaths but they don't go around killing people..\n\nThere is this thing called self control, and idk if you heard about it, but a lot of people should have this (tho we sometimes slip up, but shit happens, deal with it)\n\nA lot of people have (rather disturbing) intrusive thoughts as well, they don't act on it either, if no one had control over themselves the world would be even worse than now. And people with mental illnesses are no exception. Some have self control, some don't. But don't say someone will burn you just because they are a pyromaniac ffs.",

    "It is an Impulse Control Disorder where the person can not resist urges (not compulsions) to set fires. I guess the difference is that a compulsion is more of a \"if I don't do X a certain amount of times, then Y will happen\" and an impulse is just \"I HAVE TO DO X!!!\" It IS to make the person feel better--to relieve the tension that had been building and building. So it is close to OCD, but not quite the same. It is incredibly hard to explain. I guess the easiest way would be to say that when I start fires, I do NOT see the \"Y will happen\" part. I just want to enjoy the flames and get rid of that nagging feeling of needing to see them.\n\nWhat is pyromania to me? A pain in the freaking ass a lot of the time. I get urges to burn shit at the worst times sometimes...and of course, I have to suppress that urge, which in turn makes it 100x worse because then it just builds to an unmanageable level and I end up doing something stupid (like torching a Dumpster...twice).\n\nOh, boy are there misconceptions about my disorder, a lot of which comes from pure ignorance about it. I am supposedly \"dangerous\". I may be a fire-bug but I am NOT stupid. I hate when people assume that I don't have ANY God-given common sense. I am able to suppress the urges, but only for so long. I have been suppressing them now since January, when I had gotten released from Prison (for Arson ffs) and actually for the entire year of 2019 (that is when I was locked up)...it is now starting to come out again. I am STILL able to control it to a point. If it builds TOO much, that is when I lose control and do something destructive. I prefer to set small fires every now and again to release the tension for a while...or at least some of it.\n\nI hope this helped. I am really a gentle person, and I am somewhat of a hippie in fact. I don't eat red meat all that much (only when I absolutely have to like when my iron is super low--I am severely anemic--or when I don't have an alternative)...and I love all insects and animals.

For eg : rupturing my gums till it bleeds, peeling my lips till they bleed, picking my wounds and skin, taking drugs, taking too many laxatives coz the stomach pain feels nice, starving, just bullying urself verbally etc... \n\nSelf harm is a fucking drug and once u get into, god forbid u make it out, good luck to u to try and not somehow do it again. It's an addiction and I wish we would just treat our bodies the same we treat others. But obviously it's easier said than done.",

    "I did something stupid.\n\nSometimes I get obsessed with people, like either as an infatuation or a rival. I was talking to someone online & thought he was a friend, but then he stopped talking to me altogether. Now everytime I see him posting it makes me annoyed.\n\nThe stupid thing is I'm still pretending like we're friends, so I try to leave nice comments on his posts & such but also a few thumbs down. I think he realized because he was talking about trolls in our forum. I don't want to leave the forum cuz I like it, but I don't know how to stop feeling upset when I see him post.\n\nHow do I stop being... crazy?",
    "I honestly don't know if I am.\n\nI was emotionally abusive to my ex wife.\n\nI am Not looking for sympathy or reassurances, the Ballance between forgiving myself due to mental illness, and accepting my actions as hurtful and irreparable. is for therapy to resolve.\n\nBut i say as a someone who has done horrible things, and i may never forgive myself. BUT no one's story should end without exhausting every other option. I am doing everything I can think of to create a meaningful change, and that starts with admitting what is wrong so you can move on from it.",

You might think that your not worth anything but you are only feeling these things. I dont know you but everyone deserves everything positive the get despite the circumstances. It's so hard to register this when you feel this way, fuck I havent either, but I belive that you do.",
    "No dude, nothing positive happens to me. It is always a cycle of getting bullied by my brother (who killed a rabbit by the way), getting yelled at or my ass spanked by my parents, and me hating myself for existing. I feel like the only way out of this is to report my parents to the cops.\n\nAnd the sad thing is: i know they genuinely care about me and my siblings. They just had a lot of stuff happen to them. I feel like my life would be 100X better if i didn\u2019t have siblings. However, the only thing i dont like about my mom is her thinking that me being trans (MtF) is probably just a phase. Say, are there any trustable articles stating that being trans isnt \u201cjust a phase\u201d and that people are born trans? I do forgive mom a little bit, because she said to dad \u201ci dont want him to tell it to everybody and if it ends up being a phase, people calling him an attention seeker\u201d and stuff. My mom is very socially paranoid, gets angry at us for making \u201cpeople look at us\u201d when nobody is actually looking.",

It\u2019s just so nice when you are finally coming to the realisation that the world is not out to get you and even when you start to enjoy the little things again, like the breeze on your face.

When you're in the middle of it, it's very hard to break out of that funk do things like showering. Tbh this pandemic is the only reason why I shower daily now.

    "Kinda. My life has been a bit hectic. Just found out my uncle molested all of my aunts when he was 16, including my mom. And it\u2019s surprising because he\u2019s someone you would never expect to do such a thing. And when I asked my dad about it, he confirmed it and it kinda just hit me like a truck. I felt lied to almost but my dad being incapable to emotionally empathize with me, kept telling me to stop crying and that I was being overdramatic and that I shouldn\u2019t cry because I wasn\u2019t the one that got molested. He got even more mad when I asked him why he was being so mean to me, so I ended up having a panic attack. He screamed at me more telling me I am being sooo overdramatic. We\u2019re fine now. But on top of all of this, I realized my chances in getting into one of my dream law schools is very unlikely because my gpa isn\u2019t high enough- the law school gpa requirement is 3.7 and the max I can get when I finish college is a 3.3. So now I\u2019m here beating myself up over the fact that I screwed myself over, yet conflicted because my gpa dropped when my grandfather died of cancer and I was being emotionally and physically abused by my mother and her husband, so I try to excuse my low gpa because of that (I just moved away from her house). I also possibly have BPD or bipolar but I am unmedicated and I have constant paranoia and fear of abandonment, so I am getting into fights with my boyfriend, who is in the state I just left, because I am worried he will not actually move in with me and the distance between me and him is heart breaking. I wake up with constant headaches because I temporarily live in the common area upstairs in my dads home, so I wake up every day at 6 am to my dad and his fianc\u00e9 talking and making food in the morning, my brothers alarm clock constantly ringing because he doesn\u2019t wake up for highschool, and my step-brothers bright ass iPad shining in my face when he passes by the common area. I brought my dog with me on my move and my dads dogs have no manners nor do they understand boundaries so I am having to constantly keep a shoe in my hand to keep my dads dog away from trying to attack my dog, every day. But other than all this, I\u2019ve surprisingly made deans list the past three semesters (I had a term gpa of 3.8 this semester) and I am really looking forward to fixing my car, finally, and also getting a job and moving out in the next month or so :) oh and financially I\u2019m actually doing great- I invested in crypto and it\u2019s really paying off. Ya kno, just 22 year old quarter life crisis stuff. Thanks for asking, how are you doing?",

Dunno what to do. Just have no irl freinds which that keeps wearing me down everyday. And I fail to approach people or form a proper conversation. When people approach me I can barely get a word out and then look at the floor, then they leave.

Even with my so, who is the sweetest and kindest soul I know, I feel like a backup option. He\u2019s closer to one of my other friends anyway, and they get along much better. They also talk more frequently than we do. I don\u2019t even know if I matter to anyone anymore. I really feel like I don\u2019t.",

    "Overall, I'd say I'm doing relatively great! I had a bit of a downward spiral about a month ago, but couldn't find a therapist who specialized in what I needed help with, didn't seem shady, and was available. Only one I could find wasn't available until June. However, thanks to my great support system and various tools I've learned from my first therapist and the internet (things other people with my diagnosed conditions and a condition that I strongly suspect I have have tried) I'm doing a lot better. \n\nI started doing yoga and meditating everyday in March and that's helped a lot. I've also started focusing on my art more since I want to become more established as an artist. A little difficult with a  job and college, but surprisingly manageable. It helps that outside of work and school all I really do is art for the most part.\n\nThe only things that I'm not really happy about are my lack of social life (all of my friends are a 4 hour drive away since I haven't been able to make friends in college because covid happened right in the middle of my college career) and that I'm going to be paid less through the summer semester (I'm in a co-op program so summer I have classes so I'll be working part-time instead of full-time).\n\nBut I'm happy overall. I also just started doing my personal art retreats again which definitely helps. I didn't expect to say this much lol, like I said, I have no social life \ud83d\ude05",

    "No lol. Insecurity is not fun",

Plus I have this burnout that I feel approaching, because it\u2019s the end of the semester. This sucks though, because I\u2019ve been doing so well all semester and I could easily just fuck up all my hard work at the end. I\u2019m doing really well but simultaneously I\u2019m holding on by a thread. I just don\u2019t know.",

I don't know if this is what people usually experience every Monday, but it got me to the point where I am feeling unworthy. I am afraid I will make my coworkers in trouble because of future mistakes that I make.

I woke up at 9AM too, without an alarm! I'm still really tired because of school, and I'm struggling to focus, but like. I'm doing my best. And that's really all I can be doing. \n\nIt doesn't help the discomfort I feel sometimes with still be alone at 20, or the sweet whispered nothings when I play Overwatch and wanna just leave mid game because \"it doesn't matter, nothing really matters\". And it doesn't help the deep loneliness I feel because of isolation, or that it's going to fall off a cliff in the coming weeks as my semester ends and I don't even get on Zoom class anymore. \n\nBut my little morning routine doesn't need to help those things. Like hard stuck, burnt food at the bottom of a pot, I think at this point, the only thing that'll help those deeper issues is a lot of time and soapy water. Maybe a therapist, if I'm ever able to afford one.",

    "As mother's day approaches I'm kinda dealing with birth PTSD, three years later still.\n\nTW birth, medical malpractice, gore\n\n\nThey were *supposed* to give me pitocin in order to allow a slow, controlled dilation inducing labor.\n\nBut the intern forcibly broke my water at 1cm dilation, and my body decided it was go time. My body started pushing and within 45 minutes my baby crowned.\n\nDuring that process, I was feeling all of it. I was begging for pain care, and arguing with the nurse via intercom, and they shut my buzzer off to not have to deal with the \"need first time mom who doesn't even know what real pain is\" (overheard by our adoption agent who pitched a fit and physically dragged a nurse in when she heard it.\n\nMy uterus and cervix were just fucking shredded. I had a catheter in, so my urethra was lacerated too. \n\nMy baby got stuck in the birth canal, and, because I was bleeding internally I began to lose strength, couldn't left my hands let alone push. When I started slurring my speech they gave up on screaming at me to push, and *grabbed my vagina and ripped me open by hand*. No time for an episiotomy. \n\nThey realized the catheter was in and ripped it out.\n\nThen they pulled my baby out, and laid him on me. But I couldn't hold him, so he slipped off me while I mumble-cried for help bc I was fading out. My bf caught him as he fell, and held him while the midwife degloved and went out to get the adoptive parents. \n\nPer my request before the birth, adoptive parents were to cut the cord.\n\nWhen she came back in, she saw I hadn't passed the placenta and was gouging blood. A LOT of blood.\n\nShe reached in, no gloves, and ripped my placenta out. That scene from alien has nothing on the feel of another person's hand inside your uterus, clawing the goo from the walls. \n\nThen she stitched me up. Again, I could feel it all. Stitches up my asshole, patching up the wall between colon and vagina. Stitches across my undercarriage. \n\nThey came back every 15 minutes to check for clots, and I had them so bad. Elbows cringing into my belly to dislodge them and (gloved now) hands reaching in to pull them out. \n\nAfter six hours a new-on-shift nurse offered me a single ibuprofen. I was so grateful I broke down in tears. I needed help to even take it.\n\nI spent the next seven months bedridden, unable to stop bleeding. I couldn't piss or bathe myself, and needed help for everything. \n\nI had a bladder and uterine infection. I was in constant agony, and couldn't even sit upright.\n\nWhen I finally recovered, I discovered I'd popped my stitches somehow. I had full uterine prolapse (cervix outside my body), and a rectocele. I'm still waiting my turn for surgery to fix that. \n\nEvery menses, my body squeezes my uterus down into my asshole, and I have to reach inside my body and move it out of the way to take a shit. Once, it got wedged so tightly that the blood couldn't even come out. \n\nThe adoptive parents claimed they wanted an open adoption, like, put it in their stipulations. And they played the part, right up until my work transferred me close enough to actually have the visitation they were always talking about. Then, they stopped returning calls and texts.\n\nSo, to answer the question, no I'm not ok.",

    "I have lost almost everything in my life at age 20. My conspiracy theorist loonie-toon mother moved to Mexico and took the family dog who has been with me since elementary school or so, with her. She then left me with the tasks of 1: packing everything in the house that she didn't take or I didn't need, which means basically everything had to be. 2: Finding a new place, as the rent would be far to high at the old place (of which I had lived at for many years, and was only a block away from my childhood place) to be viable for me to stay, nevermind that she had already given the landlord the notice anyways. And 3: Handling everything else that came with this. All in the span of less then 2 weeks, with zero notice whatsoever. The only reason I managed to move everything was because of a shitton of help from friends and a lot of luck. Its currently all stored at a friend's place in their basement, which isn't a long term solution. I also, subsequently, had quit my job a few weeks beforehand due to there being no money in it due to the pandemic, as well as me hating every moment of it generally. And then, on the last day of this move, my cat that I have had longer then I can actually remember died in my arms in the very early morning at age 17, a cat who had been deteriorating horribly in health ever since everything had begun going downhill to the point he couldn't even properly relief himself in the litter box or go down stairs. I have no idea what happened, and I likely never will. All of this, naturally, while my abusive father and his side of the family breathed down my neck every single day.\n\nIts been a few months, I'm no closer to getting a job, I'm living at a friend's house like a parasite, and I simply just don't give a fucking shit. I can't sleep without melatonin anymore, I cry frequently and often, I can't contact my mother anymore besides email, and I  simply have zero reason to keep living past my two best friends, who aren't really reasons so much as anchors. I find myself more and more tempted every day to simply off myself and end it, because holy fucking shit, fuck this.",

I do the home work, i clean, cook, take care of 2 cats and of course i take care of my grandma. Last week i went to see a therapist but i don't know if she will be of much help but i Hope so. I suffered a lot from depression and anxiety for the past 7 years(i'm 24 right now) and i had psicotic breakdowns from which i never really recovered, the scar It left on me is so vivid. I'm trying to get better, i Wish i could be the old me again, the One Who had the courage and passion in everything he did. I had everything and because of my mental healt i Lost It all, i had a wonderful girl and i pushed her away from me, i had the best future i could Imagine, if It wasn't for this illness. I believe that what i have Is affective schizophrenia, that's also my father's illness, and even if i need meds to even get 0.1% better i would take It with lot of Joy. I'm hoping that everything Will work out the best this time, that i'll get better, i tried so much to be high functional, i even lived in another country where i built an incredibile Life but then i had to come back home.. it's been so long since i felt deep emotions except for anger and sadness, i'm longing so much to feel the warmth of relationships again, to feel the connection between me and the world, between me and the people around me.

    "i think its caused by our parents saying we arent good enough",
    "So, they say that young people may experience a quarter-life crisis. I'll tell you about mine.\n\nIn 2013, when I was 25/26, I had just graduated from Columbia with my Masters. So many of my peers already had so much more work experience and got great job offers. I tried to stay in NY but ended up going back home to CA bc I couldn't afford to stay. Within months of graduating, my dad almost died (complications of diabetes) and he and I moved in with my grandmother so we could care for him. I entered a deep depression. I thought I'd never find a job and would have to care for my father the rest of his life. Seeing the man who raised me look so frail and fall into a deep depression himself was devastating to say the least. I was crying nearly every day and stopped taking care of myself.\n\nEventually, I started to pull myself out of it with some help from a grad school friend. It took me months to finally get a job and then nearly a year to finally get a job somewhat related to my degree. 7 years after graduating and I'm near getting my professional license. And I live in an amazing apartment with a great boyfriend.\n\nTrust me when I say: your time will come. The WORST thing you can do is compare yourself with others. I'd recommend a social media detox. For one thing, people only broadcast the best part of their lives...rarely do people share their struggles. Another thing is, if you spend less time looking at how others live you can focus on how you live.\n\nTake care.",
    "I am struggling with the same thing right now. I took a year off of college to work and figure shit out. I didn\u2019t really get anything figured out but I\u2019m back in school now and back in intro classes.   I am surrounded by 18 year olds who think they know exactly what they\u2019re doing. I honestly hate them even though I know that comes from my own insecurities.",
    "Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t get better I suggest finding something you want to do and sticking to it I am 33 and a total failure professionally it\u2019s humiliating. Unfortunately what you do professionally really does matter people will try to tell you otherwise to make you feel better but that\u2019s just something people say to feel better about themselves but it\u2019s not really that honest. Work hard to get the job you want is the best advice I can give.",
    "Honestly, I feel inadequate when I compare myself to anyone but my past self. Don't compare yourself to others for any other reason than to learn and too grow. Don't base your self worth on the comparison of yourself to others, because the reality is that you'll never be any worse, in just the same way you'll never be any better. You wouldn't judge a tomato based on it's comparison to an apple, would you? Sure, they're both round and both red, but that's about where the similarities end.",
    "It\u2019s 100% normal and reasonable to compare your self to other but you need to remember (and this is super cliche) your only seeing the parts of their life your able too. You don\u2019t see the morning they wake up and they\u2019re so tired they can barely function, you don\u2019t see the migraines and the days they\u2019re brain tells them they\u2019re inadequate. You only see what they hand picked for you to see. And I don\u2019t mean to say this as if your weak or not as good at hiding struggle I just say this because when you wake up and you mean to be productive and you aren\u2019t, everyone deals with this many days in a row and you aren\u2019t alone and you aren\u2019t broke. Or lazy or anything and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re envied by someone and have no idea. Just like you envy people and they have no idea",
    "I felt similar when I graduated in 2011 - but I had a more stark contrast with other school friends who came from wealthier families and could afford them to stay abroad doing unpaid internships. I guess it\u2019s easier to achieve one\u2019s plans if money is not an issue. \n\nAs someone who usually feels overwhelmed and doesn\u2019t know where to start a large task, it does help to write down the goals to visualize them and come up with little easier things to start getting where you want to be. The first step is always the hardest.\n\nThis year\u2019s pandemic pretty much has killed my business, one that took over 6 years to build and I use to live abroad. I am trying not to compare myself with other friends and peers who seem to be doing ok. So I\u2019m trying hard not to feel inadequate.",
    "Thank you for sharing. As a fellow college student, I definitely can relate. Although I\u2019m neither a senior nor close to graduating (currently a sophomore in undergrad) I\u2019ve experienced something similar. I also have bad anxiety and it can be a consistent issue, making me doubt myself and doubt my future. Recently I hit a deep, dark hole and couldn\u2019t get away from my own feelings telling me I wasn\u2019t good enough, that even with my own goals and motivations I wasn\u2019t going to get anywhere. What got me out of this hole is what other commenters have also said, try to look at your past self. It might be hard at first, but there are things you can look at and identify growth. You\u2019re on track to graduate in December! College is difficult, and graduating with a degree is definitely a step in the direction of success. Try to remember that, when you feel inadequate. Success and motivation is different for everyone, find your own success and motivation, not some others have pushed upon you.",
    "You have to look at it like this...\n\nThe people that are around you are not the only people in the world. You are currently in one of the worst environments in my opinion for mental stability. You have pressures left right and centre and just like you, some of those people don't feel like they can share how they are feeling. Have you tried speaking to any of these people about how you're feeling? you might get some much needed insight! Also, social media exacerbates this. everyone is posting about all their achievements, all the things they have and all the tings they are doing. what you don't see is that them and their partner are fighting everyday, the car that they post endless photos of  is on finance that they can barely afford and there are other stresses they have to go through everyday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe human race is just winging it man! some of us take longer to mature than others!",

I saw that everyone around me was more hardworking and smarter than me, and at first it encouraged me to do my best, but now I just feel tired all the time. Honestly what helped me get over this a little bit was becoming close to my classmates, particularly the ones who did the best in class. I was able to learn that they had struggles and hardships they were dealing with and it made me think more about my own circumstance.\" It's never too late to improve and look for something that drives you\", is what I  tell myself nowadays.

    "Yes, it is a widespread concern that people have since we (as social species) tend to define our worth through the lens of achievements/goals appropriate/mandatory for our age. Just pay attention at the group you most compare yourself to, what are their interests, goals and then think whether it\u2019s something you don\u2019t like but it has socially been indoctrinated in you or whether you truly want these things (achievements/goals/hustles) too given you have \u201curge\u201d to feel the same way and be involved in similar things as that group is. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend finding people who are the same as you because you\u2019ll be stuck in this anxious state forever because it will become the new norm/comfort zone for you.

    "I think this is a feeling all of those you compare yourself to struggle with as well.\n\nSomething that's really helped me is breaking down goals in to sub goals and even smaller goals made out of them. Its great to say oh in 5 years I want to achieve x, but thats too far away to build any kind of momentum to keep you motivated.\n\nIf you say I want to achieve x in 5 years, you can break that down and say: achieve y in 1 year, z in 6 months and all the way to tiny goals that you can achieve this week.",

It took me not being able to memorize anything, starting to have blackouts during the day starting at 26 years old and multiple hospitalizations to get 're-diagnosed'.\n\nHow did I get diagnosed?

    "I think that you being in college is a thing you should be proud of by itself, you probably overthink things like me and tell yourself you\u2019re less than what you really are. You just have to do things you enjoy and go for a career you\u2019re passionate about. I\u2019m 24, had to move in with parents but honestly most of the time I don\u2019t feel less than because I really enjoy the career I\u2019m pursuing which is music....things are going well with music for the most part and I have a job that I\u2019m pretty bad at but I\u2019m blessed with good coworkers who understand my mental struggles. You honestly just have to choose to be grateful for what you have, my life is really a shit show but whenever I find gratitude and happiness within myself I not only help myself but I end up more likely to be of better service to others. Trust me...I\u2019ve been through it all...schizophrenia, addiction, homelessness, rehab after rehab, so many psych wards, loss of a family member, and I know I slow people down at my job but like I said I just have to be grateful....it\u2019s much easier said than done but maybe just try by starting out your day thinking 5 things your grateful for and remember those things throughout the day. You can do it, you\u2019re already in college which is AWESOME and you\u2019re better than you think you are. Also, you got to have good friends to talk to or just have fun with because maybe that\u2019ll help your anxiety, may be hard at first but it\u2019s worth it to just have people to be around. You got this! Much love",
    "I started uni this week and this feels a bit similar to me. I started a degree in electrical engineering and when seeing all these people in the lecture hall i feel like a kind of kid. I'm amongst the younger ones, most people had a gap year to figure things out, work, mandatory military service etc. and some have even moved out and live in apartments with friends (the concept of dorms doesn't exist here). They all have these mature vibes, and I feel like a kid here. After all, i started right after high school, failed (mandatory) military recruitment, haven't made much of my own money. There are quite a few that are the same age as me, but in person i can't relate to people here (sounds dumb to say this). I think i like chatting a lot more with some of these people in my degree. And of course the whole stress that came after 6 months of staying at home doing not much apart from learning a language. And of course I'm also a procrastinator. I'm already questioning if this degree was the right choice or if i even should go to uni",

    "absolutely in every way",
    "I struggled with procrastination in college too. I barely graduated and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Ended up enlisting in the military, where I learned a lot about myself including what it means to put forth effort, how to persevere when I don\u2019t feel like it, and how to dig deep and really try. Maybe most importantly, I learned what it feels like to truly succeed and excel, and I learned that I am a lot better at things than I used to believe I was (later I also learned that I had been struggling with undiagnosed ADHD my whole life). Newfound insight and inner strength have helped me clarify my goals and focus my behaviors on getting through impulsivity. \n\nMy advice: don\u2019t give up. I was 25 before I figured out that I wasn\u2019t where I wanted to be, that I had a dream job, and that I actually believed I could succeed at that dream job (and the work it took to get it). Maybe talk to a therapist too.",
    "There are so many of us. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re the ones that aren\u2019t as noticeable to us, we\u2019re paying more attention to the ones that seem ahead of us in life.",
    "I have felt the same way. Know that you're not alone and that there is support out there. Everyone is on their own journey in life.",
    "I was 10 years behind everyone else.  Took me a while to grow into myself I guess.  It's gotten much better as I have gotten older.  procrastination and perfectionism are anxiety coping skills - pretty bad ones because they foster avoidance.  I've worked through that in therapy and it's gotten way better.  Not 100 percent yet, but far far far better.  Needed a guide to get me through it.",
    "It\u2019s ok to struggle with this but I would try to find a healthy habit like exercising that will help increase your own confidence and make you feel like every day is being accomplished. If you can, switch up the people who are around you to those that encourage said habits. I am going through something similar at 31 years old and my little brother got me into exercising and eating healthy. It has changed my life and the way I look at myself and how I perceive other people\u2019s perception of me. We all have something to contribute to society you will find yours because I know I will find mine! It\u2019s not easy trying but don\u2019t give up!",
    "Oh man, you are not alone in this. Some of the people I was in high school and college with are amazingly successful. One of my best friends in high school works in astronautical engineering, and kicks it with famous astronauts. My best friend from college has several bachelor degrees and a masters. And then there is me, who wasn't able to get my bachelor's degree because undiagnosed bipolar screwed up my grades and my life, and I eventually ran out of aid/loans. They literally won't give me anymore loans because of how many times I have had to do a medical withdrawal.\n\nThe longest I have held any job is 2 years. My little brother used to be the \"problem child\" who always got in trouble and didn't try in school. I graduated in the top 10 percent of my class through hard work. But now he is a successful chef, and I am the problem child at 31. It is hard not to be jealous and think your life pales in comparison to others.\n\nAll I can say is, it is an unrealistic expectation of yourself. You hear about those physically disabled people who teach themselves to paint with their feet, etc. They get recognition for learning to work around their disabilities because people can SEE AND UNDERSTAND them. Mental illness is still fighting stigma and misunderstanding. So people like you and me who fight to accomplish things other people find simple, don't get the same understanding. \n\nIt is okay to not have as many recognizable accomplishments as your peers. Life, despite the American culture(don't know if you are in USA), does not have to be a competition all the time. It is okay to look at what you HAVE accomplished and feel good about it. And sometimes, just being healthy is a win. Because it takes effort!! Don't sell yourself short.\n\nAlso, some mental illnesses come with mitigating \"superpowers\". I have Bipolar 1, which is often linked to creative genius. Now, I am no creative genius, but I am an artist, and I'm decent enough. And when I succumb to mania or hypomania, I usually produce some of my best work. \n\nSo, instead of looking at your life and successes in comparison to your peers, look at what you can do because of the life you have lived and the struggles you have gone through. Look at your struggles like Mt Everest, just getting through is an accomplishment. Try to give yourself some grace.\n\nBut yes, you are not alone in this feeling, and it is harder some days than others.",
    "Don't worry about it. Fix yourself then it'll come to you.\n\nIve known lots of people who didn't know what to do, now their up to loads of passionate stuff, I've known people who had dreams and ended up nowhere. It's about how you look after yourself.\n\nMost of the people around you right now will completely change their minds or have life get in the way. Shit happens.\n\nLife comes and goes.\n\nDont worry about it. Work on yourself.",
    "Try to get out of the rut of comparing yourself to others. I do that a lot and it is terrible. I am trying to break the habit of thinking like that.",
    "I have heard people say try not to measure yourself against other people. Don\u2019t think so much about what other people are doing think about yourself. Easier said than done but it does help when you can do it.\n\nWhat helps me sometimes is if I can have things to look forward to even if they are small things. Going to the park for a walk going wherever watching a good programme on tv. It might help you have things to look forward to.",
    "I do to. Im 23 years old graduated uni a year ago. I have a great job that is pretty high paying for a fresh grad compare to other local companies in my country. But I still feel inadequate looking at my friends who have started their own businesses. Granted they are also starters but I feel like I am not working towards my goal of being an owner of a big company. I got the job easily because I was able to impress the higher ups when I was interning so the field maybe similar but its not what I want to do for the rest of my life. And I fear that I might feel too comfortable with a 9-5 job that pays nice and end up not taking risk and chasing after my dream. \n\nFor me my feeling of inadequate cam from my parents saying I have so much potential for greatness, which in return started to have extremely high expectations for myself. I have a whole timeline planned on what I should achieve by which age and I get anxious and worry that I would not be able to meet my own high expectations.",
    "I feel the same tbh",
    "ALL THE TIME. I work almost full-time at a grocery store in my home town and every time any of my old high school classmates come in, all I can think of is how much better they're doing than me and how I've done nothing in the four and a half years since I graduated. I try to remind myself that I just haven't had the chance to take the opportunities I need yet, but when the comparison is right in front of you, it doesn't always help.",
    "I feel the same exact way, I've been struggling with these feelings for a long time. I am so sorry you're going through this as well, but, boy is it a relief to hear that it's not an uncommon feeling to have. I've always gravitated more towards people who are in an older age bracket than myself anyway but as I've gotten older, 25-30 is an age group in itself and I just feel soo incredibly behind on everything. I'm new to tech, I'm new to socializing, I'm new to everything. It feels like I'm in my twenties equipped for high school (barely) but nothing further.",
    "Please don't take this the wrong way, but I laughed when I read your post. I know  e x a c t l y how you feel. I was in the same spot 2 years ago. I graduated in December and I was absolutely terrified. I also had major anxiety that had been totally exacerbated in this newfound \"adulthood\". Suddenly you turn a certain age and the world expects you to just be an adult after only being a student, it's comical. \n\nLet me tell you something, all those people who look like they've got it all figured out... absolutely do not. No one does. That's the problem with being a career student for approximately 16 years. I was one of those people who looked like they had it all together, which is so hilarious to type out because I never ever once thought that about myself. But people would tell me that. The thing is, I was living day by day just like everyone else. Second guessing every single choice I made. There's a good chance you have it more together than you think, go easier on yourself. \n\nCollege sucks the life out of you. I can tell you my life got exponentially better when I graduated because I finally had time to do things other than stress about the looming assignments, exams, overall student lifestyle that I hated so much. I get to develop as a real human now and it feels so good. I get to go to therapy more consistently and take care of myself. I can be a functional adult. I get to see my friends and family, I'm taking tennis lessons and I get to ride my horse that I never got to ride in college. \n\nThe best advice I can give you is this: Don't let the next 3 months stress you out to the point that it takes away your quality of life. Just finish your classes as strong as you can. \n\nHere's some professional advice if you want it: 1. If your school has a career center and you have free time maybe go down there and see what resources are available. The reason I got a job at Goldman Sachs is because of my career center.  2. If you want to pad your resume a bit maybe look around for internships to apply to, either this semester or for when you graduate. They always look super good on any resume, even if it's not exactly in your field. 3. Get friendly with your professors or other similar mentors, or academic advisors. Even in online classes I just got super in their faces with emails, on phone calls, and appointments to make it look like I really really was trying and then I did try haha. This is important for letters of rec which are absolutely priceless, they're not hard to get as long as they know you. \n\nI know that sounds like a lot but honestly those three things are super simple and don't take a ton of effort. The funny thing about college is I did those three things and got the same job as all the kids that were running around like crazy getting cutthroat finance degrees working their asses off, but instead I got a humanities degree and had a pretty easy time in college studying what I genuinely enjoyed and all I had to do was spend a few minutes each week emailing my professors and hacking the game a little bit? Amazing. College is a scam, you will be totally okay! \n\nSorry for going crazy on the college/career advice and less on the mental health advice but if you do want career advice in the future feel free to dm me!",
    "Yes constantly. Im making a below average salary because I just got out of college last year. I just turned 25. I have schizoaffective and it delayed me. I feel so far behind, Im looking at all my classmates on instagram and they are in med school and having kids and here I am just starting out.\n\nBut there are also people in worse situations. People generally post their best selves publically. Im sure plenty of them have challenges and insecurities too. \n\nComparing is dumb, it doesnt help anything, but I cant help but do it sometimes. Im working on it",

    "I feel just the same. Trying to compare myself to people my age ends up just making me fall more into that hole as I realize how far behind them I really am. It\u2019s okay to live and grow at your own pace regardless of societal expectations. You got yourself through college, you should be more proud of where you are and not worry so much about others around you. Everyone\u2019s on a different path and yours does not need to look like those around you.",
    "Thank you for sharing man, I needed this more than you can know. I'm in my last year of high school and feel exactly the same way, behind in everything from studies to ambitions and clarity about life goals. All of them are involved in something and I'm just here... It's been eating me up inside for more than a year.",
    "We tend to compare ourselves to our peers to know \"where we are\". I know it's easier said than done, but **don't compare yourself to others**. Focus on your life, mind your own business. They're doing their thing, and you're going to do **your** thing. Watching them accomplish stuff doesn't do you any good. I've recently been feeling a lot like that, and I've been reminding myself of this. If you have debilitating anxiety, see a psychiatrist. I recently started muting instagram stories of people whose posts constantly me feel bad about myself",
    "So I am 46 and working in a field I love, married, with a child and own my own business. I still feel like others are much more mature than me. I think back to my aunties at my age and they looked like adults and they all were housewives. I remember the panic when I graduated at 22. What do I do now? I was told go to college and you get a good job. It wasn\u2019t there and the bar had been placed higher. I feel like after spending 16 years in school, where your job is school, it is scary to know what to do next. I fumbled around traveled some and ended up working in the addiction field. I love it and I know I make a difference but when someone asks me about it it seems like I have done nothing even though they are impressed. I have figured out it is not about what others think but only if I give myself credit for what I have achieved and that is hard for me. I don\u2019t think I will ever feel like an adult bc that is some imaginary thing I made up as a kid. Everyone else is just better at pretending to be grown then I am. The good news is I laugh way more than other people my age. I don\u2019t take anything to seriously bc that does not make an adult it just makes me miserable. Also studies say the more intelligent you are the more likely you are to say that you are not an expert at something and know there is always more to learn. You are not alone and hopefully you will take the opportunities that come your way or make some of your own. Each one really does give you something to use even if it is not the perfect job.",
    "I am struggling comparing myself with others. I don't know where the problem began or maybe I just grown envious of what others have in there life. I have very loving and supportive parents and they never once compared my achievements with other people. I know the problem is me and I am trying so hard to have a positive mindset and stop overthinking on things. I think I need affirmation coming from myself and accepting the fact that some things are just not meant to be.",
    "Heyy! Never compare yourself to others! You're perfect the way you are! We should live life at our pace. Life isn't about doing things the most efficient way, it's about living it our way, you know? If you don't wish to be actively doing stuff, that's completely fine. You're one in seven billion! You're amazing! Life isn't a race between you and others, so don't look at what others are doing, and feel the need to do something. If you want to do something, you should. When people say \"You're supposed to have done this by this age, or should be settled by this age\" stuff like that, ignore them. You're not on a timer. Live life at your own pace, a pace with which you're comfortable with. Cause a pace that isn't naturally yours might be exhausting to you. It might make you uncomfortable. You're who you're meant to be, and your pace is the pace with which you should go in, you know?   \n\n\nIf you wish to understand why you feel what you feel, I think you should take a break, and try to connect to yourself.

Life's about having fun, and spending time with your loved ones! Life's about finding out what you're passionate about, and doing it! You're one in seven billion! You're perfect the way you are! Everyone's great at something, and everyone can be great at something if they do what it takes! Everyone is a genius in their own way! If you haven't found out what you're passionate about, keep looking! Here's the thing, people love watching passionate people do their thing! Whether it's streaming games, or singing, or whatever! Do something you want to do in life! Follow your passion! Follow your heart! If you do what you're passionate about, everyday, when you wake up, you'll embrace the day instead of going \"Ugh, I have to work today\", you know? It might not be sunshine and rainbows all the time, but it's something you want!\n\nLife is like a marathon! It's about the journey, and not the destination! You run for yourself, you run with your friends and family, and eventually, you'll find someone that you want to run the rest of your life with! ;) Do what you want to do! :)\n\nAlways be yourself! :) It's important to understand that there are things out of our control, and one shouldn't worry about things that we can't do anything about! What we do have control over, we can do something, so we shouldn't worry as much! :) What's meant to happen will happen! :)\n\nI wish this helped! :) Take care! :) I'm here if you ever need someone to talk to as well! :)",

    "same. Although I've come to understand that it's the brain looking for a way out of the experience of the anxiety - because I'm not in a logical frame of mind, that seems like the only option. If I realise that it's not life I want to escape, but actually the anxious mindset, then it can be easier to understand",
    "I can relate to this so hard. While explaing this to a therapist, she replied with a very validating thought that helped me at the time. It became an addictive escapism during times of distress, so much so that it was my brain's path of least resistance. After hearing that, I felt like it was easier to step outside the suicidal thoughts and \"observe them\" rather than my \"why am I like this\" self hate spiral. I'm like this because of my trauma. Only then I could move towards strengthening the other pathways in my brain so that suicidal thoughts etc aren't the only response my brain gives me.

Being in a big family, nobody would tend to notice anything was wrong but this went on for years (and sometimes still occurs but I can eventually snap myself out of it). Catastrophising (assuming the worst case scenario) was the result of not being able to manage my emotions and would result in my wishing for death for that would at least be an end to the feeling that I'm worthless, unworthy of friendship and love, and forever alone. I'm almost 40 now and I see the same sort of thinking in my daughter but the kicker is that she was diagnosed with ADD and catastrophising is common with this diagnosis. It is also common for people on the spectrum.

It\u2019s definitely working but very hard, it requires patience, exposure to triggering events and the presence of mind to see what you\u2019re doing and the strength to choose to do something different. Therapy is great because you have someone who can support you while you learn to do that and help out with it.\n\nHope that helps, sending you love.",

I'm going to get tested for it at my request, but I'm not diagnosed. if you're able to, I definitely recommend getting a second opinion or switching therapists \n\nIt's not cool that your therapist is dismissive. this is definitely a concerning thought pattern that they should be walking you through and I wish you the best of luck",

I just deactivated all my social media and blocked all my friends numbers. I'll probably never see them ever again because I dropped out of school and they live far away from me. It's weird that I don't care at all.",

It started because of school stress (not being able to keep up AT ALL), getting kicked out of school, starving myself, weight gain, toxic abusive family that called me lazy for getting so depressed, getting ghosted from a guy I liked, losing all my happiness, giving up on obsessive exercise which resulted in me getting fat again (gained 35lbs in 2 months) this all happened from October-December and it's fucked me up bad, I still can't get over it",

She thinks ppl with ADHD are hyperactive and energetic.\n\nAnd my therapist says I just have anxiety. (I don't even get anxious much, I sometimes get panic attacks but it's rare)",
    "You might want to look into a psychological phenomenon called \"splitting\", aka \"black-and-white thinking\": https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology)\n\nIt's essentially a psychological defense mechanism where people have trouble constructing a mental model of situations or relationships that integrates both the good and bad aspects; things are interpreted subconsciously as either 100% good or 100% bad. This leads to emotional reactions that can be dramatically out of proportion to minor positive or negative events. Other ways it often presents are very rapid transitions back and forth between intensely positive and intensely negative emotions and love/hate relationships with other people. It's most commonly associated with Borderline Personality Disorder, but can be caused by other things as well.\n\nI don't know if this is what's going on with you, but it was the first thing that jumped out at me.",
    "Look up the symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder and see if it sounds familiar to you. Don't self-diagnose, but if it sounds like it's the way you think and feel, then you can at least talk to a professional about it, and you can get a tangible idea of how to make those feelings manageable.\n\nI say this as someone that is diagnosed with BPD, and I hate seeing people suffer the way I do.",

Patience and effort. Awareness is a good first step. So in those moments is a good point to challenge thoughts \u2014 what else could I think to make me feel less intense? Less like I want to die right now? What\u2019s upsetting me so much and how might I think about it differently? If somebody is insulting me, rather than take it personally, maybe I think, oh, maybe they\u2019re having a really shitty day and they\u2019re taking it out on me. It\u2019s their problem, not mine. Idk. Maybe I\u2019m oversimplifying \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f just trying to help though. Edit: by the same token, I also try to look for truth in things for self-improvement\u2014like is there any truth in what somebody is saying? Even if the truth hurts?

    "This sounds like me as well. I have a small number of people I would consider very good friends (less than 5). What helps me is making sure I'm checking in them instead of always expecting them to check on me so that I don't get into the catastrophic mindset that they've forgotten me and/or don't like me anymore. Usually we're all just busy and going through different phases of life. People love to know they're being thought of and it dispels the things our scumbag brains tell us. Managing relationships is a huge source of anxiety for me as well.",

Something I suggest looking into is psychedelics, specifically lsd or shrooms but preferably lsd as usually it\u2019s easier to have a trip on. 1. I\u2019d like to say there\u2019s many reasons why you might not want to do this and all of them are 100% understandable, it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve studied a lot and like recommended to people as a natural and can be a 1 time experience to majorly help with mental illnesses. 2 If you want to research more into it, weather that\u2019s just for entertainment or actually thinking of doing it, I suggest watching Explaining: the mind - psychedelics by vox on Netflix\u2019s. If you can\u2019t watch that you can also just ask me and I can give you the basic run down of the video and how it works in the mind as long as some research papers so you\u2019re not just taking a random strangers words for it. Just dm me if you want. If not that\u2019s fine. \n\nI really hope you do finally get the proper help you need, and a therapy who can actually help.",

I lived for decades with the understanding that my life would end by my own hand. Not planning, necessarily, but thinking about it. \n\nThe instinct to kill ourselves comes from the devil and his demons--it is their purpose, their only reason to be. Are you inviting demons in through meth or other means? \n\nMeth and some other substances open a door to those that profit from your loss. They climb inside you and animate you like a sock-puppet. I've witnessed this many times. \n\nSounds odd, I realize, but try thanking God for this world and for making you so uniquely gifted. Ask Him for help with this situation. \n\nYou might be surprised by how quickly you'll find relief. \n\nYou are truly loved. Never forget that. \n\nNever give up--fight back. Be a warrior.

Not everyone will have the same symptoms but one thing for sure is the ability to pay attention in either school or having a convo with someone, it's hard and people think we might playing around but it's just the brain trying to grasp a sense of what just happened... So that's why you might ask people to repeat themselves, during a conversation... Idk tho I might be wrong but like try and speak to your doctor about it... Also try meditation it has helped me tremendously with anxiety... Just make sure to practice whenever you are alone or wont be bothered..",

    "Well I don't want to try to offer an armchair diagnosis, but my ex-wife has BPD so this is a subject I've read pretty extensively on. I can tell you what I've learned and you can see whether it sounds similar to your experience.\n\nAccording to the DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) theory of BPD, it's caused by someone who is biologically predisposed to feeling emotions more strongly and for longer than most people being raised in an environment where they don't learn how to regulate their emotions effectively. As a result, people with BPD are predisposed to a \"cycle of catastrophe\" where they feel an intense negative emotion and need to address it externally, so they make a decision that will help them feel differently in the short term like bingeing, overspending, using drugs or alcohol, cutting people off, substituting a different emotion like anger, etc despite it leading to longer term problems, which are then responded to the same way, perpetuating the cycle. So for example in the case you mentioned, the BPD psychology would be skipping plans because of feeling depressed, which would lead to emotions like guilt or shame because you feel like you're letting those friends down, which would be responded to by avoiding them, which creates negative emotions due to not having social support, etc.",
    ">Told my therapist, but she always kinda dismisses what I say. She thinks I just have anxiety.\n\nPlease find another therapist, that sounds all kinds of wrong.",

Most of them IMO are garbage, look for people with IFS, EMDR and Somatic training, but even then it can be a crapshoot in many places. Good luck",

    "Someone suggested to me that anything under 100ug and you can\u2019t have a bad trip. You can still also microdose which is actually way better at helping with long term mental illnesses than just taking a trip. I know multiple people who have said it has really helped them. I can actually send you the story of someone else who I was just talking to the other day. \n\nFunny enough, I\u2019ve never taken any delics before, but I\u2019ve been thinking more and more about it. I have a love for psychology and drugs are cool so I really got into learning about how it works on the brain and how people behave while taking them. Honestly the more I learn about it the more it gives me peace of mind about possibly taking it (I have really bad anxiety so I\u2019m have bad anxiety that I\u2019ll have a bad trip while taking it, and if you go into it thinking you\u2019ll have a bad trip, than most likely you will)\n\nEdit: Also that is really odd, most likely because both of them are depressants. Alcohol never mixes well with a bad mindset or even a good one, depending on if you are frequently having a bad thought or mood. I actually haven\u2019t studied a lot about alcohol and weed, so I couldn\u2019t completely say why you experience this, these are just my observations and theories.",

I lost weight last year after starving myself but I gained 40lbs back in 2 months from the extreme binging. \n\nBut I don't think I feel emotions really intensely. I usually just don't care at all. Or I just block everyone and leave cos I don't have the energy to deal with anything. \n\nI've been thinking I probably have depression. But idk man. I don't even understand my emotions most of the time but maybe that's because I grew up with an abusive mother and an absent shitty father. My mother always dismissed my emotions and told me to stop being such a pussy. So maybe that's why I don't notice how bad an emotion is until it gets too bad",
    "Yeah ikr. I tell her how I always block friends cos I randomly hate them and how I delete social media randomly for no reason just cos I suddenly hate everyone on there but she says it's an anxiety thing. I don't even feel anxious much, but she keeps saying I have anxiety.",

    "Yea I used to take Citalopram but I got weird side effects from it.",
    "Precipitation is changeable, especially on lsd. What happens while on lsd is the neurons in your brain deattach and reattach to different neurons that they originally were not connected too. As voxs explained put it, it\u2019s like when you\u2019re going down a snowy hill on a sled, as you continue to use it, one path usually become the main path. Lsd/shrooms is like a new snow coming down that allows you to take new paths down the hill. Most likely, at first you will have these original feelings, but if you meditate or try hard to think \u201cwhat I\u2019m saying isn\u2019t true, it\u2019s never/very rarely been true in the past with other things I\u2019ve convinced myself of, and this will help me with my problems like it has for many people in the past\u201d, it will change your mood and perception of the trip. Obviously I know this is harder to believe especially when your mind won\u2019t allow you to think differently, but I\u2019d assume with how lsd works it might be easier to say this and believe it. Also I still believe trying a microdose would be your best bet as you have no real change in visuals, and it\u2019s not like an actual trip at all. It usually just makes you more creative and you start to view things differently. \n\nOnce on weed I have a view flip (like my view just really quick reserved itself and went back to normal) and that fucked me up for a good 30 minutes to and hour trying to convince myself everything was find and how I was feeling was good.",

You could have just dismissed my opinion. \n\nAlso...Islam. \n\nI learned what I know underneath the city of Las Vegas. Where did you get your training? \n\nThe answer is always right in front of you. I love you and hope for the best for you.",

    "Oh fuck off dude.",
    "I'm sorry, that sucks so much. The mental healthcare system is awful. If you ever do have the option, your best bet is someone who specializes in DBT. I don't know where you live, but do you have the option of socialized insurance or government-subsidized treatment programs? Another possibility if you're somewhere developed might be a sliding-scale clinic or a non-profit social services group.",

I've never really had a problem with spiders so it's odd.",
    "That is a very understandable. Psychedelics aren\u2019t for everyone an anyone who\u2019s ever tried them would know that, if you think something really bad would happen from it than you shouldn\u2019t take it so. \n\n\nThis was a really nice conversation though, I enjoy talking about delics with people",
    "Again, right there with ya but at the same time even when a person has depression if there\u2019s something that really excites them and consumes their mind they will draw the motivation. So maybe even though in your mind you really need a solution but none are convenient enough try smaller steps. And you can even make it something you enjoy. Excercise was just a two birds one stone type of idea",
    "I live in England. I'm getting free therapy, I had to wait 6 months for a therapist. Therapy doesn't help at all, I keep getting worse. \n\nAlso during therapy I seem really normal and put together, she has nooo idea how bad this gets.

    "Agreed. My in-laws are \u201cvery understanding\u201d about my anxiety issues, but then guilt my wife behind my back when I don\u2019t want to attend one of their many many many social gatherings. Two-faced.",
    "Yeah I\u2019ve had someone get pissed at me for something and say something like \u201cI\u2019m tired of dealing with your bipolar $&@!\u201d when what I had done was perfectly rational.  People who always go for the low blow are better left aside.",
    "Agreed. I had a childhood friend who always gaslighted and emotionally abused me for my mental illness. She left me recently and acted as if she\u2019s a good person advocating for mental health on social media. I have yet to get over this and i\u2019m still annoyed and upset.",
    "Agree. I have faced this as well. It's hurtful and insensitive. I've either cut off from or kept minimum contact with such people.",
    "This is why I took a social media break. I hate seeing people post hotline numbers and when I post that I am having a bad day, I usually am called dramatic or no one reaches out when I literally ask for help (like on Snapchat with people I have known for years). I removed people who saw it and didn\u2019t say anything. \nThen I deleted the app. It\u2019s been nice.",
    "This shit hurts so much. Even tho you are in contact with people, they make you feel much more lonelier than you would be completely alone.",

    "I had a friend like this. She would act all caring when we rarely talked about my mental health issues. I don't like talking about them because I feel like others are too quick to judge. Well, this friend who acted like she cared would show her true colors when I was having an anxiety attack or any other major mental issue. She would tell me to stop acting like a child and get over it. It didn't help that this girl was also a narcissist. Never disclose any of your weaknesses to a narc. They will most definitely use it against you.",
    "I have been helping people with mental health problems for decades and really dedicated my whole life to it. However, there's a lot of \"wtf\" about mental health problems. \n\nI used to have a client, back in like 1996, who kept his poop in milk cartons in the fridge because he thought it was magical. I can't get it out of my head. \n\nI have talked about this, used it as examples, joked about it, and it's just because it's so strange it's hard to process and let go of. \n\nI have a female friend of mine who I think it the smartest and funniest woman I have ever met. However, she \"likes\" being addicted to drugs. She has been raped countless times, and once she passed out in a trap house and woke up to being gangraped, and asked the guys for money, according to her. She is also a street prostitute in this horrible part of town called Kensington in Philly. \n\nShe grew up with bikers in her family than had her on drugs by 8 years old, and \"sold\" her for other things. I know her mom that was part of it and so forth. So, I get she has massive trauma an is the product of that. \n\nHowever, she is smart, gives excellent advice, is philosophical, and can keep up with me in a discussion which I respect greatly. However, all the stuff I just mentioned plays on my mind when I speaking to her sometimes. I'm like, I love this person and admire her----but maybe she's crazy!! \n\nThat's an extreme example, but I'm used to extreme situations. Most people are not and so when they know you have a mental health problem, it's like saying you're radioactive, and they can't stop thinking about it. \n\nThat's why you should keep stuff like that private or only tell people you absolutely believe in.",
    "100% agree.",
    "My employer has all these posters at work about mental health and how to get help etc. They\u2019re everywhere. I was struggling and went to Human Resources and my Manager to ask for help. (I had discussed everything with my Psychologist first.)\n\nLong story short, they refused to help. I told them to take down the posters. Ridiculous to have them up offering false hope to people who are struggling!",
    "The WORST is work bosses OH MY Gawd! They take you into a meeting (because they need you as a worker, not because they care bdw) all pretending like \"I can't believe you're having to endure this\" \"Must be so hard\" bla bla bla, then few days later start treating you like shit, making you as stressed as possible and mocking your behaviour as 'weird' with their co-workers, mocking your ass. It's so frustrating how little empathy some people have and how well they will fake being 'professional' just so you don't quit, so they can continue using you to get promoted. 2 faced to the Max!",
    "People just don't understand I think. My mum does the same to me, she does shit like threaten to phone mental services to have me sectioned over dumb shit that no one would ever get sectioned over. She and my sister talk about me on the phone all the time, she goes and embarrasses me in front of friends like I'm a child when I'm a grown ass 28 year old man. It's actually really bad for my head but I'd rather put up with that right now and be around her, my cats, other family than be alone and have to suffer all my thoughts by myself.",
    "My dad is like this all the time, he even joked with my brother about me killing myself, and that if I cut I should make sure not to get blood on the floor",
    "My step mom, she would say that I\u2019m not actually depressed and shit because of this and that and says I don\u2019t have anxiety because I just don\u2019t like to talk (think about that one) but when we go out with family or family friends she talks about how she\u2019s helped me get over my things and I just sit there because I can\u2019t talk when I\u2019m too anxious or angry",
    "I think it's very childish of those people and they need to know better.",
    "That was my Ex big time. My mental health got destroyed the last 6 months and it took me sometime to find a stride again. It sucks how many people don\u2019t really support the movement. Mental health issues are real",
    "Yes I know this is serious but I was the 420th upvote so :3",
    "It\u2019s not only a very bad look for their character but it also showcases just how ignorant they are, anyone with any basic understanding of mental illnesses and how they affect people is not going to say so much bs. \n\nThe fact that they hide it sometimes it\u2019s just to show they know they\u2019re doing something shitty but in their minds they need a little power trip to tell themselves they\u2019re \u201cnormal\u201d and anyone else is not. \n\nI also hate the mental illness taboo and anyone who still tries to perpetuate that. It\u2019s 2020 for fuck sakes, therapy is not something to whisper, psychiatry is medicine, the people who refuse to accept these facts are 10/10 times your usual insecure individual trying to live under societal expectations.. so they project their social insecurity in other people. \n\nI remember just how devastated I was when I came to the realization that I was mentally ill, I thought I suddenly found out I was subhuman, that other people were somehow better because everyone would treat me like shit then. \n\nA lot of problems we think we have in life are nothing but the problem of somebody else who decides to make it *our problem* because they take no accountability.",
    "Yep I'm sick of it too. But what you gonna do?",
    "Agreed. I have narcolepsy. Diagnosed by a doctor with sleep studies. \nPeople that have no clue have actually tried to tell me that it's all in my head, that changing my diet / exercise routine would cure it.\nSome act like it's an excuse, that I'm just lazy & worthless.\nAfter being diagnosed & put on stimulant meds so that I can function fairly typically, I am treated as a drug seeker or a meth head / speed freak by some. Despite the fact that I have taken meds exactly as prescribed for over 10 years, never even tried street speed, and have to pass drug screens on a regular basis.\nAlso, however, with stimulants, I am not \"speedy\" at all. I am often still tired, still require naps at times. The meds just enable me to not have to take 7+ naps a day. \nI am far from lazy. Before I had any issues with narcolepsy I was an A-B student, kept up with many activities, my social circle, projects, etc...I have always been a hard worker.\nWhen I was first experiencing narcolepsy symptoms and didn't know what was going on, it was the lowest point of my life. I suddenly couldn't seem to stay awake for anything, no matter how important to me or anyone else. I literally hated myself and still feel a lot of traumatic shockwaves from that period. I absolutely did feel worthless and I hated that, but I was powerless to change it all on my own. I still feel guilt and worry about how I may have let others down during that period.\nNow that I function fairly typically, sometimes when I accomplish something big that I worked hard on and I am proud of, it is dismissed as, \"well, yeah, I could do that if I were taking speed every day, too.\"\nVery hurtful.\nIt's often referred to as a silent disease, and it seems many regard it as not being real because of that.\nIt's okay, though. I am grateful of the ability to be awake and living my life again. I prefer dealing with the hurtful comments if it means I'm not asleep 80% of the time.",
    "Yes, most people are bad listeners. they try to normalize mental health issues when they cant find better answers to questions. It shouldn't be that way.",
    "You and I have that in common: a feeling of frustration. People may mean well, but they come off as uncaring and (worse) as if they're gaslighting you/me. The easiest way to disregard your point of view is to say, \"You're just having an episode.\"\n\nI have empathy for the people around me, those who wonder if I am having an episode or am merely being a jerk. (The two are not mutually exclusive.) At the same time, I wish they had more empathy for me.\n\nAlthough I'm not as insightful as I would like to be, I have noticed that people who are venting do not like to be told they're wrong. Perhaps this is because feelings are never right or wrong; they merely are. It seems to me that the people who try to correct you are the ones who are projecting their own lives, experiences, and filters onto your situation. Perhaps I'm being overly cynical.",
    "If someone uses your mental health issues as an ammunition, it only shows how stupid they are, so use that, use their stupidity as your ammunition. Say 'No, your just too stupid to understand it.'",
    "My shitty family in private: Omfg get over it! Your eating disorder is annoying and disgusting and you look like shit! You\u2019re so awkward and weird! Stop using medication, it\u2019s a crutch and it\u2019s actually making you sicker! Why aren\u2019t you pretty and outgoing like other girls? I don\u2019t wanna be seen with you around our cool friends! \n\nMy shitty family where all their friends/other family can see/hear: Be kind! You have no idea what other people are going through! Mean people suck! Love no matter what! Namast\u00e9!",
    "1/2 of mentalli illness is not conforming to society, it seems that people want to pretend everything is ok, and you are the one who is not ok...its to the point now where if I odnt take the meds, they will just drag me into the hospital and cllaim I am not taking care of my self.  Pushing people around until they get what they want from them is what mental health care is all about.",
    "I always experience the opposite. \n\nPeople tell me 1 on 1 that they support me and will do whatever to help etc. Then another person walks in and they start treating me like shit again.",
    "My mental illnesses often aggravate or show as physical illnesses. One of my now former friends stopped initiating communication, and seemed distant. When I finally got the nerve to say something their excuse was well your ALWAYS sick...yes, yes I am and I had no money or time to care for myself. The moment when I needed them I was denied but then they got angry I cut them off....",
    "Agreed",
    "My mom was bragging to the doctor about how she \"knows a lot about mental health because she worked with a lot of mentally ill people\" but then a few weeks later told me my anxiety wasn't a mental illness and it was \"just a thing\" :/",
    "My sisters didn't invite me to Shakespeare in the Park 2 years ago because they thought it would make me manic. I told them it wouldn't and then they said \"You wouldn't know what makes you manic\". \nAdmittedly, I am not an intelligent person however, I don't think this is a highly intelligent argument and yet, I still don't understand why that was their argument.\n\nI really wish they'd just be transparent and say, \"We don't like you. That's why.\" Don't act like you care. Either do or don't.",
    "This bugs me too, if anything is going to be helpful it's others you can talk with or those who want to understand about mental illness. It can be healthy having an open discussion when it promotes respect and understanding. Only sometimes you get those who pretend to care and speak from a place of privilege and indifference to others because \"we all make choices\". When it's mental health related there has to be a respect for life, without being judgemental or hypocrite.",
    "Guess what buddy, this is the world. The world we live in won't give a shit whatever problems you have and in fact for the most part take it to their advantage. For example, someone was trying to fight me and admittingly said \"im mocking the fact you have autism\". This is how human beings are nowadays, im sorry but they're behind and lacking.",

    "I agree 100%",
    "I've had this said as well. My immediately response was, \"I may be bipolar, but at least my arguments are still rational unlike yours, without a mental disorder...what does that say?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGranted, not the most mature response but o.o Don't aim below the belt thinking yours is safe xD",
    "Omg. My college roommate felt she was the best advocate for mental health. After I spent a week in a mental ward, she said \"I just can't deal with you anymore\". Four years of \"support\" and \"friendship\" bs. Im sorry that you went through this too. \ud83e\udd17 support hugs",
    "Honestly, it may be my depressed as fuck self trying to rationalize this (currently feeling extremely apathetic) but I think you should publicly call her out. Sometimes, people like that deserve their true colors to be displayed for everyone to see. Especially, if they\u2019re trying to portray a more tolerant image of themselves online. Hypocrites.",

    "Man good news!\n\nI just want to say one thing that has opened my eyes a lot, and may be interesting.\n\nFirstly, as intelligent, self-aware beings, it only makes sense to me that suicide should be a natural choice.  It appears to me that our right to death is as important, if not even more so, than our right to life.  I think in almost all cases, the decision to die is often made hastily and out of temporary emotional distress, and is (as you point out here) most likely a mistake.\n\nI say this just because I think the subject should be approached differently than it is in society today.  It is not wrong to kill yourself, but it is also not any better than just simply being.  I think it is something I may have heard from Alan Watts in his lectures on zen that the spirit world/ death just isn't viewed as any different from life.  Anyway, the last thing I want to say leads on from this which is that living in the present moment is a retreat.  Practising mindfulness, breathing, is something that has been revolutionary to me.  It really helps gain a third-person perspective on your life and realise that your emotions are just emotions - they guide you, but they *are not* you.  Listening to guys like Thich Naht Hanh on his monestary's youtube channel Plum Village has been really useful for me this past year.\n\nPersonally I got off antidepressants around a year ago because they seemed to make it worse, and being more mindful and physically active seemed to work for me, but if that's what works for you then keep it up.  Just know there are more options, and more routes to health.  Life's an ongoing, individual experience.  Your psychiatrist doesn't have all the answers either, only their own.  It took me a while to realise the best solution for me was to leave (medicated) psychiatry, it just wasn't an effective tool.",

He said:\n\n  \n\"Happiness isn't meant to be experienced all the time, if it was we wouldn't appreciate how good it feels when we do feel it. Those moments of happiness and joy just give us something to hold onto in the dark until we get to the next happy moment, which will come if you just hold on.\"\n\n  \nI think about this so, so often and it helped me to reframe my perspective of what I \"should\" feel like. Hold on to those moments and search for the things that bring you some joy, no matter how small. Maybe its just seeing the new spring buds on trees or something, but recognizing them can be helpful in reminding your brain that everything is not awful all the time.   \nBest of luck to you! always remember we are here when you are struggling!",

I've seen male experiences of trauma and childhood related anger and anxiety ridiculed as blatant lies and excuses for abusive behavior.\n\nA yet I've seen the same female mental health \"advocates\" approach these issues very differently in women. Outbursts and neglect must be tolerated by the man in the relationship, because his female partner is just working through her trauma. If a woman goes through a difficult break up with a man and publicly (on social media, where else) calls him out for being abusive (which nowadays refers to a very wide umbrella of behavior which they deem toxic or problematic) the man must not be defended or allowed to provide his own context. He is trash, never to be defended, never to be trusted again by anyone. \n\nBecause he is a man, he must be the culprit and the woman his victim. Because women cannot be emotionally abusive in this view. Even when they hold the power to destroy a man's life by blaming him for all the problems they had and publicly ridicule him, directing shame, harassment and threats his way. Because that is apparently fair and a good thing.",

I'm pretty sure black kids are more likely to be dxed as oppositional defiant.\n\nI think more of what you seem to mean is that society is really uncomfortable with people expressing their feelings in general. And more so that men are certainly expected to not express their emotions or have any display of emotion beyond anger which is totally unhealthy. Not allowing men to be \"feminine\" or feminine in this way (lol which is not femininity and just sexism) causes a lot of problems for everyone and as a society this way of thinking needs to be exterminated ASAP.",

    "Is this even a mental health issue? He was tearing up because Jada essentially humiliated him on TV by describing how she became \u201centangled\u201d with another guy while they were separated.

I should also say that some older and often male mental health practitioners do hold a gender bias in dishing out this dx since they were around when it things were extra gross. I think these people are responsible for a huge chunk of stigma surrounding the dx and misdiagnose and mistreat people.\n\nBPD is probably going to be changed to be included under CPTSD in the near future. This is something I agree with as it will alleviate stigma and acknowledge that BPD is a trauma related disorder and should not necessarily be categorized as a personality disorder.

    "Right on, you nailed it. \n\nOP is bringing up a valid point of an example of how mental health (particularly the mental health of men) is often not taken seriously but the conflation does not make sense.\n\nWill Smith was mocked for expressing an emotion other than anger, which men are typically taught to repress, which is obviously toxic to anyone's mental health. But Will is not mentally ill, he's simply going through a challenging time. Kanye is ill and is very unwell atm. Kanye is probably the present day pinnacle definition of ignoring mental health issues in America. \n\nI will agree with OP that men's mental health issues are often blatantly ignored no matter how extreme.  But the attention women get for any behavior out of the ordinary (that is often not even remotely near mental illness) leads to them being depicted as crazy, hysterical and out of control as a result. Look no further than Britney and the endless conservatorship, whereas Kanye is just being Kanye!\nAnd this leads to the conflation of Will and Kanye because many people don't view Kanye as mentally ill, just eccentric.\n\nWe have a long way to go as a society when it comes to mental health, but it doesn't discriminate against one gender, it just looks different.",
    "No problem, I get it I honestly shouldn't be surprised because getting most people to believe any dx is real is challenging.  I can now see how people may say that there's nothing wrong with but that you don't act how they'd like. So I see how noting that \"difficult\" women were often dxed with BPD makes it sound like it's not real. I think the criteria also had a change relatively recently between the dsm 4 & 5, not 100% on that. You should read Girl, Interrupted if you haven't it has characters that are clearly correctly dxed with it and others that are probably not like the author Susanna Kaysen. It takes place in the 1960s.\n\nAlso, since your psych feels that way, you can ask her to change your dx to a trauma disorder NOS since CPTSD doesnt exist in the dsm yet if you want.\n\n What I was worried about and still worry about for others is that a BPD dx is subject to a lot of stigma and discrimination from healthcare professionals in general. Honestly I've had doctors be dismissive about totally unrelated conditions because of my mental health conditions that they knew about and BPD wasn't one of them. I have been in the ER with an injury and acute PTSD from that accident and my injuries went untreated because they didn't believe me. I had to go back when I was more mentally sound and basically go off on them for that. I have a number of friends who are social workers too and they strongly advised against having a BPD dx because they see a very high level of discrimination in their field everyday that is rivaled only by schizophrenia.",

    "As soon as I saw this joke, I understood immediately. It is kinda funny. I am on equivalent of Zoloft. Sometimes I just dont give a shit. Like, all can crumble down, and I dont care. I mean, I care in terms of cognitive part of me, but not emotional. But in defense of antidepressant I am taking, I would be an emotional wreck without it. I would be sad, very angry, and I would have verbal tantrums without it. I dont think I would be able to do my job, because I would surely enter some verbal fight with some co-worker. I remember my tantrums, and I dont want them. \n\nI was also worried that I wont have empathy (I noticed that my emotional empathy has weakened), but few times I felt it again. My co-worker was struggling, and I felt sorry for him. In the same time I was glad and sorry, lol. Glad empathy is not dull totally, and sad for the guy, and I tried to help him. So yes, antidepressants can make your emotions blunt. But you are still same person under that bluntness, just a bit more in control.",

    "Depending on what kind you are taking, this seems more common when you've been on the same antidepressant for several years. I've been on prozac since I was 12 and I'm 32 now and this has been a problem for me for the last 7 years or so. This shouldn't scare anyone from getting help and starting them though; sometimes you have to switch antidepressants, because after being on the same one for so long they stop working.",
    "That is what happened to me in a nutshell. I was on Zoloft, and I had an absence of emotion. My psychiatrist told me that there is a term for it--emotional blunting, and is a known side effect of anti-depressants. \n\nComing off of anti-depressants was like moving from reading a book and being in an immersive film. The caveat is that because I was on anti-depressants for so long, I am going to therapy to specifically handle my emotions.",
    "You\u2019re not on the right ones!!",
    "Sometimes it frustrates me and I get off my medication, but then am promptly reminded of why I\u2019m prescribed them in the first place.",
    "I cannot say this has been my experience. At all.",
    "Antidepressants make me a way better person than I was without them. I take Pristiq. I'm much more positive, tolerant and proactive as a human being. They aren't all bad.",
    "Antidepressants are weird, they had me numb for months, then I had a mental breakdown :/",
    "Seeing this reminded me to take mine, thanks!",
    "I feel like although this is a joke, its detracting from the overall effectiveness antidepressants have on people and discouraging it as a positive, helping thing.",
    "what if i already \u201cfeel\u201d like the second panel, then what the hell do i do /: lol",
    "I got to a point where I feel things too strongly and didn\u2019t have healthy coping mechanisms. I was constantly overwhelmed with emotions and anxiety. Literally all the time. So when I put on medication it helped stabilize my emotions and got me to a place where I could actually handle day to day life and eventually my trauma. \n\nI can understand the post because that is what Prozac did to me as a teenager but my current medication (Zoloft) changes my life. I\u2019m still on it but I\u2019m finally getting to the deeper stuff. If you feel empty ask for something else. Sometimes it\u2019s a nice break though. Good luck everyone!",
    "i never had a word for how antidepressants made me feel until now, thank you",
    "I\u2019m so glad mine work closer to the top than the bottom. But I had to go through a lot of different ones to stop being the bottom.",

    "Have they made anti depressants that don\u2019t make my teeth go to hell and make me depressed yet?",
    "The main difference between being on and off antidepressants for me is that when I\u2019m on the pain is not so excruciatingly urgent and raw that I want to solve it by killing myself; the pain is still there, but instead of actively wanting to die I just feel numb and exhausted, which at least means I can do a few basic mental activities per day as opposed to being in nonstop emotional agony.",
    "\u2728no feel\u2728",
    "How do they work?",
    "There's a ton of misconceptions with anti-depressants.  First, that they are expected to work the same for everyone or to simply work for everyone.  One medication may alleviate symptoms of depression for Person A yet it may make depression symptoms worse for Person B.  Second, that anti-depressants are supposed to make you feel numb or emotionless.  Feeling numb or emotionless means something is wrong.  If the medication is working properly for you, you will no longer be depressed and you will feel positive emotions strongly.  If you feel numb and depressed while taking anti-depressants you must tell your doctor.\n\nIn July of 2018, I started Zoloft.  Within a few weeks I was pulled out of my severe depression and I was feeling REALLY well everyday.  Not even manic, just really well and depression-free every single day for the first time in my 25 year life.  I was numb before I started the medication and within weeks I could feel again.  I woke up crying, elated because the war I had been fighting for 25 years finally was over.",
    "I never took medications, but I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s the effect antidepressants gave them",
    "I only trust in Diazepam (Clonazepam 5mg here in Argentina) and maybe nice music but when you're really fucked up Diazepam always can make you sedated and smiling like a dope person. I love feel the wind in my face when I'm on Diazepam in the bus, It's like all the bad things in my mind are in rose colour. The bad thing is then that pills are addictives and maybe they can fuck up your neurons. \"A sedated society are manipulated more easy\".",
    "I can't feel sad if I can't feel anything",
    "I can confirm this does indeed happen, they\u2019ll turn you into a zombie. And if you tell your doctor they\u2019re not working, they\u2019ll just put you on more antidepressants",
    "Fucking facts",
    "Suppose I'm practically already on antidepressants. Never feel shit dude it's been years.",
    "I find you still feel things, it\u2019s just a distant sensation. It\u2019s the same way that you can feel the discomfort of a doctor peeling open your skin and messing around inside under anesthetic, you just don\u2019t feel it *directly*.",

    "Basically emotional numbness is fairly common on antidepressants",
    "the way i interpreted it, is that they don't make you all that happy, they just make your serotonin release better. they sometimes make people feel more motivated, but still colorless. more motivation helps you make you happy though.",

    "It isnt free but i know there are online options to talk with psychiatrist and get prescriptions in the usa. Some google-fu will bring up a few options im sure.",
    "You cant become a sociopath because of antidepressants, so dont worry. It is just that neuroticism has weakened (emotional reaction is more under control). In my opinion, caring too much is also not good. So maybe you are better off with new situation. In my case cognitive empathy is still strong, which means I think that something is bad and I wont harm no one and that if somebody has some problem I will understand it by reason. But emotional one is a bit weaker, but it is still there. I am glad it is still there. I dont want to be careless person.",

    "Its a weird cycle of self abuse, but you dont realise thats what it is. \n\nAs someone with an ED myself youd be surprised just how deeply rooted it gets. Unlike anxiety or depression (which i also have) you can sort if white knuckle it and come out the otherside and work on it but an ED is a constant creeping.\n\nAnd not all EDs look skeletal. I swing back and forth between anorexia, bulimia and binge eating. Im overweight because whenever i diet i takenit way too far. What starts as a perfectly normal diet turns into beating myself up for not having a smaller number on the scale than yesterday. Its loosing 70lbs and not being able to see that ive lost that weight so pushing it further. And once you get to that point 9ne of two things happen. You get stuck, or like me the pendulum goes back and i binge all that weight and more back on. \n\nMy eating disorder didnt come from control, it came from everyone telling me i was fat when i actually wasnt. I was a size 12. But i was told i was fat so much that i started dieting and still being called fat and that pendulum swing was only small at first. But enough to loose a stone in two days and slowly put it back on in the next 5. And this was highschool.\n\nI had family members telling me that i needed to split a 400 calorie sandwich into two meals. That i didnt need two pieces of toast. And so i fell into thier habit of eating one meal a day and surprisingly still being \"fat\" \n\nNow i actually am fat and that sick part of my brain longs to look like OP before treatment. To be so not fat that i can dissapear. So that people dont shout things at me in the street or avoid me on public transport... and yeah im big but im not 600lb life big... and thats the sad thing.",
    "I had an eating disorder ages 18-21 maybe 22, and I wish I would have just learned that it IS all calories in calories out, plus water weight fluctuations. If I had accepted that as the fact that it is, I could have safely lost the 10-15 pounds I wanted to lose. Instead, I starved myself completely for 3 days or so, then if I magically wasn\u2019t lots of weight lower, I would binge, back and forth, until I was quite underweight but not trusting that I could eat a regular diet without ballooning up in weight. \n\nYour comment about losing 14 pounds in two days reminds me of that mindset because it is thoroughly impossible, that\u2019s only water weight. Otherwise you\u2019d have to burn/starve 49,000 calories in two days which is impossible. But our brains see that number on the scale and forget all else. I just wish they taught more about food and how calories work in school so some of us wouldn\u2019t have been so afraid.",
    "See there are a lot of factors that can infouence those fluctuations but because all thats pushed is numbers its hard to not focus on that. Instead of being a number or trying to reach a certain number i wish they focused on overall health. The quality of food, the quality of sleep and regularity of moderate exercise. \n\nMy issues stem right from birth. It was never about anxiety or control for me. It was neglect that instilled that need to eat now because later was never guarrunteed. Then it was simply poverty and a caregivers own disordered eating being pushed onto me. Im 29, and i was only diagnosed last year by chance because the therapist i was talking to mentioned getting refferal (which the GP was somewhat trying to discourage me from) \n\nIve never in my life been able to respond to my own hunger cues. Along with other basic cues like tiredness or the toilet. The binge is fuelled by restriction and that innate ingrained need to seek and eat. To hoard food for later. But the message has always been that im too big, which i wasnt. But now i am and im struggling to loose weight in a healthy manner. Its a slippery slope from just managing a \"normal\" diet, to skipping meals entirely or purging because its always pushed that if i just try harder, i wont be fat anymore. And ergo if im not fat anymore im not disgusting, useless, lazy ect anymore.\n\nBut the fact is, my needs were never a priority and as such i never learned to recognise them.\n\nRight now, im personally practicing to not say no to myself but to also actually listen to the cues. So if i want chocolate, i can have it, but i dont have to eat the whole packet. I dont have to clean my plate nor do i have to eat before im actually hungry. I will still cook the meal for the household but set mine aside and reheat it when i actually want it. Which also in turn helps me to not binge because the meal is already prepared when im not hungry as aposed to cooking once i am.\n\nIts a weird muddle of things that still culminates in the same fucked up behaviour as I and the others in my therapy group at the time came to realise.\n\n(And i now realise i repeated a lot of what you replied to...)",

    "Gah. I get it.\n\nHeres what I do.\n\nI hate, hate, hate, dishes.\n\nI allow myself 20 minutes. 20 minutes is the amount of time I can say to myself \"you can manage this much\". I give myself permission to walk to the sink, start the timer, and go. \n\nAt the 20 minute mark, I am allowed to walk away if I just can't manage any more. However, 90% of the time, I have got into a groove and am happy to just continue on and get the job done.\n\nWeirdly, looking at a chore in my mind while I procrastinate and think of all the reasons I don't want to do it is almost always far worse than the actual chore itself.\n\nI don't ever say, \"you are going to go into the kitchen and do all of the dishes, mop the floor, clean the benches, and put out the trash\". It's too much and I find it I try to take that on I shut down. \n\nWith this 20 minute thing, it feels more manageable and gets me started. Usually that's all it takes. If I don't manage to complete everything usually another go the next day will get me through.\n\n_\n\nWhen I was at my worst, I started a gym routine. Some days I could barely get out of bed.\n\nSo instead of telling myself \"you're going to the gym\" (instant overload and shutdown), I would say \"just roll out of bed and put on clothes\".\n\nUsually I could manage that much.  Throwing in a tee shirt, shorts, shoes is not rocket science, right? \n\nSo then I would say to myself \"just pack a bag\". Still, I wouldn't think any more steps ahead, or it would all look too hard, and I would end up back in bed.\n\nNext was, grab the keys and get to the car.\n\nOnce I was in the car, usually it was enough to be able to turn the ignition and let muscle memory take over. The rest took care of itself. \n\nThis method helped me a lot on days when doing anything felt impossible. I managed to start, and stick to the routine. I still go 3 - 4 times a week. \n\nSome days I still feel shitty, but just do the same thing, but with larger steps. \"Just get yourself there and walk in\". I never tell myself \"you have to do a full gym workout with 100% effort and every single stretch and rep\" because that would feel like overload on bad days. Simply getting myself there (starting the ball rolling, if you like) is almost always enough.\n\nAnd I allow myself a treat when I complete a workout. Nothing fancy, just some kind of food I really like and don't normally eat at home. Rewards are always good as long as you don't overdo it.\n\nLittle steps. Don't break off more than you can chew. Be gentle with yourself. Forgive yourself if you can't do a thing. Sometimes it's enough just to do what you can manage on the day. Some of the task is always better than none of the task.\n\nGood luck",

The good thing about seeking help as an adult is that no one gets to tell me what the reality is, I can choose who I see and always have the freedom to leave if I choose to, and I want to be there for myself.

    "I feel this on a deep level. I had to go to therapy cuz someone in my household was in rehab and I didn\u2019t think anything would come up with it. They ended up diagnosing me with anxiety and severe depression, I was 9. I ended up making my mother pull me out of therapy cuz 9 year old me didn\u2019t want to hear that I was carrying guilt and baggage. My parents didn\u2019t tell me my diagnosis until years later cuz it would have stressed me out.",
    "Something neat is my therapist says the other approach they are taking on diagnosing symptoms rather than assigning conditions. Symptoms totally overlap and can seem like one thing but another. It\u2019s brilliant because it works and your not left saying gosh i possibly have x,y,z. It\u2019s really neat that i see results from just examining, changing my actions and working on myself.  Like damn i may ramble when i get stressed or super offended when someone gives me criticism, or I\u2019m so hard on myself when something does go my way. I may have x, y, and or z but i can do better, i can avoid the traps i set for myself and others.",
    "Lol! I can relate! \n\nI used to think I just had a learning disability and bad depression.\n\nAfter 4 psychiatric hospitalizations for suicide threats and attempts I was finally diagnosed with: \n\nMajor Depressive Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Bipolar 2 disorder, CPTSD, and Anorexia-purging subtype (not counting my learning disability Discalcula). \n\nA grand total of 5 mental illnesses. \n\nI cried after learning I was more f#cked up than I had previously thought. \n\nThe bright side is I'm now on some pretty sweet drugs that mellow my ass out! \n\nHarrah for psyche meds, alcohol, and weed!

    "Social Anxiety was a \u201csurprise\u201d diagnosis in college as I went out of my way to avoid people and was terrified of pretty much every social interaction. Then Depression and ADD were \u201csurprises\u201d in my late 20s even though I dealt with them all my life and it explained a lot. It was all stuff that I was like \u201cno, I don\u2019t have this\u201d then I would go home and do something so characteristic of that disorder and be like holy shit, this explains everything.",
    "I kind of wish I could have had a proper diagnosis in school. I just got ADD. I believe it was an accurate diagnosis. It was not overly diagnosed back then and I genuinely suffered in school due to difficulties focusing, spacing out etc and the subsequent mistreatment by certain teachers. \n\nI also believe strongly that I also had at least some form of anxiety disorder. I started feeling terrified of going to school in 2nd grade. I still remember the dread to this day. I would SCREAM and cry. I saw counselors at school for that. They were convinced I was simply \"clinging to mommy\" which is crap, looking back. I was fine, loved school, and then I wasn't. What happened in my brain? \n\nTo put it simply this feeling continued through high-school. It manifested differently. I still cried a lot. I started feeling trapped in my body. Trapped alive. I felt dread, terror, emptiness and lots of loneliness. But I was older then and I didn't choose ask for help. I just skipped a lot of school. I got really good at it and coasted through on good test grades and projects etc. Although I almost got kicked out a couple times for truancy. \n\nSuicidal ideation started somewhere around 13 but I would tell myself I just needed to experience a few more things in life and then I could leave consciousness. I held a blade to my wrist for the first time at 16. Subsequently at around 18, and then again at 25. I did not tell anyone. I was able to talk myself down each time to stay for my family. To experience just a little more before I leave.\n\nThe last time, 12 years ago at 25 I made a promise to myself...Kind of like a pact I guess. If I didn't do it then I wasn't ever going to try again. I knew what I was choosing and I chose life, no matter what. If I was going to do it later I might as well have done it right then. \n\nI went on a \"growth journey.\" I worked to see the value in being alive, even through the feelings in my body thoughts in my head. I coped very well for years. \n\nAnd i'm losing my handle on it right now. I'm trying to approach it differently this time. I'm trying to talk about it as much as I can. I'm telling anyone who's genuinely interested in how i'm feeling. I reached out to a doctor. \nI think i'll be ok but it's so challenging right now to wait to hear from the psychologist.\n\nI'm finding it hard to focus on anything but my health. I don't want to paint, draw, read, watch tv. And yet I can stare at one spot on my wall for an hour. \nI try to do my physio exercises and find myself either crying or spaced out and not knowing for how long. \nI feel grief. It's hard to sleep. I wake up feeling hollow and panicked. My brain and spine are vibrating a lot and I feel dizzy more often than not. I feel restless and constantly driven and yet so fatigued and slow. I want to do everything but I feel like doing nothing. I feel like i'm moving through water. It feels difficult to face another day. Writing about it helps a little...",

I lived so long in fear of the stigma of treatment and labels and it is no different than having any other medical condition.",
    "Good for you for reaching out!\nHopefully when you are paired with a psychiatrist you feel comfortable with them, but I would also highly suggest a therapist as well. The best places are the ones where the psychiatrist and the therapist work in the same building. They have access to one another\u2019s notes and it promotes optimal care. \nI suggest a therapist in addition to a psychiatrist though because generally psychiatrists are a bit quirky. They\u2019re not REALLY trained to talk with you like a therapist is. \nWhen I received my most jarring diagnosis and I tried to ask the psychiatrist about it he only said this is just to help us treat you better. Which is all fine and dandy but I needed to talk about it. My therapists at the time were only grad students and because I was not presenting like the textbook version of that diagnosis they were very invalidating ...\n\nWhile you wait for appointments look for support groups in your area. The one I\u2019m in is meeting virtually which was really nice to have my first meeting that way because I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder so meeting for the first time online was a little easier than driving to the spot and meeting everyone face to face. \n\nAnother suggestion is looking up mental health hotlines for your area. There\u2019s the general suicide hotline and such but there are those that exist locally. I\u2019ve had to call a couple times and I find those a little more helpful. \n\nMy final suggest for you is a DBT skill called opposite action, because you said you\u2019re finding it hard to motivate yourself to do the things you know you enjoy. The skill is exactly what it sounds like. For me I\u2019m trying to pick up my sketchbook again. I bought a new one and a couple new pencils but I haven\u2019t drawn in it yet. I want to but there\u2019s that barrier there and opposite action is all about (these are my words) saying fuck you to that barrier and drawing anyway. Even if it sucks. Even if it\u2019s not your best just do it. Use opposite action to do those little things that make you happy, even if you can\u2019t quite feel that satisfaction yet, just keep pushing against that barrier. \n\nI hope all that helped a little! It sounds like you\u2019ve been doing really well, and that you\u2019re strong willed in fighting your mind. There\u2019s nothing wrong with needing a bit more help at times. We all fall down, even those without mental illnesses do, we just have to keep going and keep advocating for ourselves.",
    "I will warn you guys to smoke moderately though. Especially when on psychotropic medications. There are certain predisposed people who can experience psychosis as a result of smoking too much for a certain period of time. \nI think those with the predisposition generally have underlying mental health conditions but that\u2019s just my guess. \n\nI agree it should be federally legalized but I just want to warn others because I don\u2019t want others to experience what I went through.

    "i used to be the same exact way!! separating facts from feelings can be very hard when you are depressed, but it is so soooo important. the best way to start healing is by correcting yourself. if someone says \u201cyou are very pretty!\u201d and your mind says \u201cugh what a lie.\u201d then you can look to your higher self & you can tell yourself, \u201ci\u2019m allowing my insecurities to come between accepting something that will make me happy.\u201d it is important to acknowledge the changes you want to make whenever you have those negative thoughts! <3 please try not to get down on yourself too much. easier said than done :(. but everything starts with you and it doesn\u2019t matter how long it takes you, this doesn\u2019t make you weaker than anyone else. you have an obstacle to face and that\u2019s completely okay. im not sure if you needed to hear that last part but many people do. sometimes when i still dont feel my best, i just fake it till i make it with the confidence lol. eventually you can believe the compliments people are giving you. just NEVER FORGET to feed yourself good thoughts and INTENTIONS\ud83c\udf1f. never stop reminding yourself about how important positive self talk is",

I had to leave him with my cousins since I was moving.\n\nNow, I went thru really dark eras in my life where I was so so alone and had no one to talk to, so at night, i would go over to his fish bowl on my dresser and talk to him about whats happening, how i feel like, and asking him questions about my self worth and all that. and he would put his face close to the place where my finger would be, and, yk, i felt like someone actually *listened* to me, like, they're willing to share in my sadness and hoplessness, and for once, i didnt feel alone. i would cry in bed at night and then go over to him and just ask why everything is the way it is. and just cry and cry and cry. he was always there, waiting for me, always within close distance.\n\nAnd then i had to move\n\ni would ask my cousins on video call if they can show me bob and they would just laugh it off, ignoring me\n\nid ask my mom if she can ask my aunt about bob. my mom asks and my aunt makes a stupid joke about frying him and eating him for dinner. and then she says he died and laughs. i thought she was being legit and i felt this deep agonizing pain in my chest and went to my room and cried and heaved and every breath i took hurt. i was in so much phsyical and emotional pain and my head started throbbing. the next day i yelled at my cosuin through text and told her what kind of a shit person she was. i gave her one thing, ONE FUCKING THING to take care of, and she couldnt even do that.\n\nlater on my aunt told my mom that bob isnt actually dead and that she was kidding (my cousin prolly told her about the texts; fuck her)\n\nand so i never asked how bob was anymore. no one takes it seriously, and he may dead, or maybe hes not, id rather not find out, but he was a good fish. i loved him when there was nothing left to love.\n\nso yeah. i dont know exactly how your pain feels, but i undersatnd that its really hard. im sorry your cat left.",

We have all of those and more.  I read your comments and I tell myself that I have experienced them so frequently that I give them numbers like this is a 23. Lol.\n\nI have been in therapy for 30 years. Sometimes I would share these ideas with the Dr and he would just nod in acknowledgement. I interpreted it that it sucks to be me. Lol\n\nI cannot answer your questions. Some of them relate to future events like trying* to see the other side. There is an answer - it will get better, it will get worse, it will stay the same.  I just lived day to day and tried to survive that day.\n\nAnd yes it can get better. After 50 years, my bipolar illness just went away. It was a breathtaking experience. And I mentally put my depression in a box and put it on a shelf. It is still there but I do not have to deal with it day  to day.\n\nI read these posts and draw conclusions about the poster. I do not judge them I just observe. I like you. I think you will do well. Never give up.",

    "My brother committed suicide last summer and it is the worst thing that has ever happened to my family. We didn\u2019t really get along when he was alive, but I still think about him every day. My father, who was always a \u201ctough guy\u201d is now an empty, broken man because of it. He\u2019s cut himself off from his friends, doesn\u2019t go out (even pre Covid) and seems like he\u2019s just waiting for his time to wind down. If it weren\u2019t for his other living children, I am certain he would have taken his own life by now. I\u2019m sure it probably seems to you that people don\u2019t care. I assure you, they do. Even internet strangers care. It also probably seems that whatever problems you have are insurmountable. Please don\u2019t give up. Please. All you have to do is make it through one more day.

You may experience a bit of shock and a floaty feeling for a bit (YMMV of course) so I want to encourage you to take small, gentle moves today and the next couple of days. Wrap yourself in warm blankets. This may be the sign you need, but it\u2019s also a sign that you are in deep need of compassion and care *right now* too. Is there someone in your life you trust to ask to come sit quietly with you? And fuck COVID or I would offer to come sit there myself.

    "I know you're obviously going through a lot right now, I hope you find inner peace. Having said that is there any place you can go or people to stay around? Im not even suggesting the psych ward has to be where you stay. Maybe being alone with thoughts and feelings at the moment led to this?  I know personally it was a big part of my relapse and issues, especially if something upsetting happend. I can't explain in words how peace and acceptance has made a huge improvement in my life, I used to see many Drs, have taken everything from lithium to lamictal trying to fix myself. I have gone from anxious and hurt to a brand new person, mostly from listening to others with mental health issues, and finding ways to relax myself without anything. (Rosicrucian incantation sacred sounds feels like you're floating after 1 time). I know people who seek peace through the right Dr and meds and sometimes  that doesn't work out and only makes you more insane, after 10+ years I realized  a more therapeutic healing was what I needed. I'm not telling you what to do I'm just sharing what has honestly helped me so much, I'm sure others will disagree and that is fine , I say this as someone with heavy a diagnosis and just one or two. I wish you the best and hope something helps you in time.",

I only know this for sure because 18 years ago I tried to end my own life and failed. I'm truly grateful for it. Get some help. Sign your self in to a hospital and seek help.

    "I love this drawing! I\u2019ve been doing similar types of stuff just tryna get it all out of there, and I\u2019ve learned a decent amount on the way - it\u2019s an excellent means for overcoming trauma and other preverbal adverse childhood experiences (that\u2019s why the no words, it\u2019s actually called Alexythymia). We should totally do like an art interpretation thing with these to try and crowdsource will our collective knowledge the right words or descriptions for these! My experience with a bunch of books I read was that like when you come across the rights words describing your inner state you *know*.  \n\nI remember reading Christine Ann Lawson\u2019s book on mothers with BPD (which mine has) where she wrote something about denigration and the deep internalised shame that accompanies it that \u2018takes away a child\u2019s feeling of their right to take up space\u2019 or something and being like \ud83e\udd2f holy shiatsu this is exactly how I feel!!! And it was a massive breakthrough for me. I didn\u2019t know - like I didn\u2019t properly buy into all that stuff you read about being able to say it out loud and then it\u2019s not stuck inside you like it\u2019s an actual part of you anymore - but it\u2019s like that. \n\nOnly it\u2019s better because semantics are crucial to metacognition - thinking about thinking- and, for me, proper reflection (as an adult now) into those feelings was the way out of those crappy yelling voices in my head. Every time I untangled a memory of an experience and chased it back that little bit further by looking at *why* I\u2019d done that \u2018horrible shameful\u2019 thing that I was denigrated for, I realised I\u2019d done it for a damn good reason, so regardless of the method of chastisement, the chastisement wasn\u2019t appropriate in the first place, and every time I did that, I\u2019d get rid of one of those voices up in there. It was an incredibly empowering experience- and it felt *really* good. Like aloe on sunburn. And pretty much ever since I\u2019ve just been trying to find the best way to put it down as a roadmap for anyone else struggling with the same stuff because it was awesome- in the sense of \u2018awe\u2019, which I read somewhere evokes this feeling like \u2018everyone should see this!!!!\u2019 maybe because it\u2019s too big for one person, I dunno. \n\nAnyways I hope maybe I\u2019ve offered up a couple words for you! Don\u2019t stop drawing, like ever, you\u2019re really talented and pictures like these say thousands of words, every one of them the right one \ud83d\ude09",

If so it's not because you did anything wrong, but because THEY are failing to understand you!\n\nIt takes strength to understand other's.\n\nDon't worry about the people who don't understand.  They might act tough like they're just mentally stronger than you but really they're not STRONG ENOUGH to understand you!\n\nI learned so much about your struggles from this painting.  Your emotions are strong, but for good reason.  Someday you will discover the purpose of your very strong emotions and it will all make sense.",

When people offered me those it only made me frustrated and angry because I felt like they didn't care.  It wasn't true, of course; people were at a loss as to how to help and doing their best.  But I know from personal experience that a person in mental health distress doesn't experience it that way.  That person feels like they're being fluffed off by the indifferent.  That's why I avoid doing it.\n\nIn order to do more, to say anything that would be of real help to my fellow mental health problem sufferers, I'd need to feel stronger and more competent than I do now.

    "About 6 years ago there was a facility that opened up near me. Its purpose was to take in at-risk people, who were not yet suicidal, to get help. It was kind of like inpatient hospital lite. The staff was well trained and pleasant. You saw a psychiatrist almost daily, had one-on-one therapy, goal planning, some group therapy, art, meal planning, pet therapy, watched movies, and went on walks. We were also allowed time out on the porch as it was not a locked facility. And *gasp* it even allowed people to smoke if they wanted to.\n\nI had stayed there several times and it kept me from getting bad enough to require a hospital stay. Unfortunately, due to poor promotional work, it was not well known to the public, most didn't know of its existence, and it closed after a few years. \n\nThis, in my mind, is the type of care that we desperately need more of.",
    "In some places suicide is illegal. \n\nIt\u2019s sad that a community would rather rally around someone who commits a petty crime and they have a tear jerker story of how they ended up in the situation. \n\nYOU shouldn\u2019t have to commit a crime just to receive help. \n\nI love you",
    "Personally have been rejected from therapist for being suicidal. Being suicidal is not taken seriously until you actually end up in the hospital. You could have suicidal thoughts and you can attempt to commit suicide, but it\u2019s not until you\u2019re almost successful when you actually get help.",
    "Conversation between me and the hospital:\n\nMe: \u201cI want to get admitted.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m diagnosed with PTSD. I haven\u2019t slept in several days. I\u2019m experiencing paranoia and delusions and disorganized thoughts and behavior and am having vivid intrusive thoughts I\u2019m having a hard time telling from reality. I spontaneously quit my job. I keep doing things I don\u2019t remember. My psych and therapist advised me to go the hospital. My family and medical team want me to go to the hospital to keep me safe until I get a change in meds and calm down.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cAre you planning to hurt anyone?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cDo you have a plan to kill yourself?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cNo. I\u2019m in hell but I know it\u2019s temporary. I just can\u2019t trust my behavior and I don\u2019t know how bad this will get.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cWe can\u2019t take you unless you have an active plan to kill yourself.\u201d\n\nSo finally I realized I had to say yes, I had a plan. And then they asked me to describe the plan in detail. And I had to make up from whole cloth how I was planning to off myself. And it was documented everywhere. I hung up the phone on them and redialed them six times before I could bring myself to lie.\n\nI feel like a recommendation from my psych should have been enough. I\u2019m self aware enough of my mental health issues to know they\u2019re temporary and I shouldn\u2019t act on it, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t severe!",
    "thats the funny part, ive been suicidal for years and i have barely gotten any help..",
    "Right. Currently going thru crap with my husband and it's like everyone is far to worried about him. Like I don't exist",
    "Omg! Right?! I\u2019m dealing with this rn. Even though I am suffering my psych tells me I am doing well. My SI has not gone to making a plan yet..so I\u2019m fine. But my anxiety is killer with the lowness. Blah\u2026says she doesn\u2019t want me in the hospital. What does she expect me to do?",
    "Amen! I've been saying this for decades. By the time it gets out of control, it's usually too late for intervention.",
    "it\u2019s not as great as the one you\u2019re talking about, but local to me there is an agency that has crisis stabilization units (open to everyone). they\u2019re a non-inpatient facility but you stay there for around 3-7 days. you see a med provider, have check ins with clinicians each day. sometimes there\u2019s groups. there\u2019s tv and games, an art room. it got boring at times but it\u2019s definitely better than a hospital stay. definitely something that should be more widespread.",
    "Yes if there was some of these spread around the country (usa) it would defiantly help a lot of people.",
    "There are shelters like that all over the US and most other western countries but *only* for one demographic with one type of need.\n\nKeeping any other kind of shelter open is all but impossible because nobody's re-election hinges on funding it and it's considered fine to actively oppose it when people try...",
    "That sounds amazing\u2026 add exercise and take away the smoking, and you\u2019ve really got something. \n\nAdd psychedelics (which help with PTSD and depression) and you\u2019ve really got something more\u2026 but still take away all the smoking\u2026\n\nMust mask and vaccinate\u2026\n\nMust live communally and contribute to either society or at least do chores for the upkeep of the program\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s like a co-operative, or a kibbutz.",
    "How is suicide illegal? Maybe attempted suicide? Life if you succeed, what they gonna do?",
    "Yup. My friend tried to commit suicide and instead of going to the hospital, she was in the parish jail for six months and had a whole bunch of fines. This was in louisiana",
    "hey if you ever need to talk dm me you can rant or we can just talk",
    "Heard that. I would usually agree that those are reasons for a place like that to close down, but in this case it closed due to a mix of poor advertising/advocating for the place, and its location. It has a sister facility from the same company in a different region, and it has been successful for years. I cant say what it is like there, as I have never been. But if it is anything like the one I was at then its residents are getting quality care that I haven't seen anywhere else. I kind of gush about that place mainly because it was not privately owned and just about anyone from any economic background could get in, as well as a variety of mental health issues and substance abuse issues. The world needs more like it.",
    "Sometimes insurance companies lobby to make it illegal so they don\u2019t have to pay out your life insurance since you committed a \u201ccrime\u201d. \n\nAlso, a rescue or police team could kick down your door because you are \u201cattempting a crime\u201d",
    "What the hell!? Please tell me she is out and alive.\n\nMake it illegal, but make the punishment address the root cause of the crime. She needs to know her worth but she\u2019ll never find it in a jail cell.",
    "My gran thinks you should get life in prison for attempting suicide to stop people from killing themselves, which is ironic because I have tried to kill myself 3 times",
    "Yes she's okay and doing well! Its been about 3 years now. She was able to get it expuoff her recorded.",
    "Your gran sounds like she is frustrated that she can\u2019t save people so the only option in her opinion is to lock them up to keep them safe. \n\nI see that a lot, people don\u2019t know how to help so their logic is to put up barriers and restrictions that actually backfire. Someone like me is going to challenge every barrier and every \u201crule\u201d that says I can\u2019t do something.",
    "That\u2019s awesome! Love to you both",
    "She's a shitty person, she used to work at a special school and this one kid kept having meltdowns when they did finger painting so she and some of the other teachers kept him after class, held him down and smeared paint all over his face, she was laughing while telling that story and she thought his screaming was funny, I've stopped visiting her because of this, she also called me and my sister attention seekers for cutting and attempting suicide, so fuck her.",

This gives such a silly and negative portrayal of mental illness suggesting that mentally ill people are \u201cunstable\u201d and dangerous while at the same time painting mental illness as some kind of quirky character trait. It\u2019s neither; mental illness is serious and debilitating for the person suffering from it and it does not mean that said person is \u201cunstable\u201d or a dangerous or toxic person to be around. In fact a lot of people with mental illness just want to be seen as normal and could stand to benefit very much from forming normal healthy relationships with people and they try very hard to do so and to overcome these kinds of unhelpful stereotypes.",

I\u2019m not entirely sure why that helped... maybe it helped take the pressure off,  There wasn\u2019t a real \u201cperfect\u201d to achieve or strive for. There were just a couple \u201cyeah this is okay\u201d options. \n\nAlso it was sort of a dark joke between us about how no one is ever that happy and if they are it is probably bad for their health. Idk.. couple depressed people making dark jokes about normies I guess: \n\nIdk.. I like that first frame. It has a sort of unsettling quality to it. It makes me laugh.. like the cake episode in Hyperbole and  a Half.  \n\nThat first frame is sort of a reflection of a lifetime of mistrusting happy people and not believing they could really be happy.. which is funny now, because we actually are pretty happy. And we don\u2019t feel that way anymore.. but it felt important to still include it.. not sure why.  It sort of honors that experience of being in a darker place for so long. \n\nBut yeah I can totally see how it could come off as mania.",
    "Thank you",
    "Thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard. Just cus you're not \"truly\" happy doesnt mean other people cant. I would have just deleted the first one.",
    "I know this might be stupid but whenever I speak to my family (mostly my grandparents) I basically have to completely detatch myself.  \n\n\nDon't look at them the wrong way, so they don't get ticked off. Don't listen to all the nasty things they say, so I won't get upset and basically don't say anything, that could even remotely be considered criticism or else they will rip my head off.  \n\n\nEverything I say and do is wrong, as long as it doesn't go 100% along with what they believe and think. I am so so sick of it honestly.",
    "  Thanks for sharing and so sorry. My former parents and grandparent were so negative, critical and overly opinionated. \n\n  You have to leave your grandparents alone. If they don\u2019t have a heart to contribute to your inner-peace, success and overall well-being then its not the wrong thing to do. Just because they are blood relatives doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re their punching bag.",
    "Wow. This hurts to look at. This is exactly how it feels when I talk to some of the most important people in my life. Block out all the hurtful words, they don't mean it. They love you. Don't look at them when they get like this or the wrong way or else you'll do something wrong and get yelled at. Be careful with what you say it can be used against you at anytime. I just want to hold myself as I look at this. This is honestly beautiful in a bittersweet way. \n\nGreat job!!\n\nEdit to add on*",

    "Therapist here. The amount of misinformation and overgeneralization of mental health issues on social media is something my colleagues and I are very concerned about. The amount of teenagers self-diagnosing with Disassociative Identity Disorder is RIDICULOUS.",
    "This pisses me off so much I can't even explain. Those \\~quirky and special\\~ people on tiktok or social media in general consider this more of a fashion statement or a personality bonus rather than an actual mental health issue. Most of them are not.... even diagnosed?? \n\nUnfortunately, most people nowadays think that being sad = depressed, which is just not true and actually offensive.",
    "I hate tiktok when it comes to mental health (well, I actually hate it in general but-). Rarely do people talk about it realistically. Having social anxiety is not \u201ccommon\u201d in the sense that everyone has it. People are associating getting slightly nervous around new people as social anxiety, but that is completely normal. The problem is, because general people haven\u2019t experienced real social anxiety, THAT is what they think it is, so therefore they tell people to \u201cget over it\u201d. When in reality, they don\u2019t understand and they need to educate themselves. \n\nIm going to use teenagers as an example since mostly teens are on tiktok: as a teenager, a lot of us have anxiety to talk to people at the register when buying things. That is normal. We are young and we don\u2019t have the experience or causality around strangers, especially adults, like an adult would. But, being afraid to the point you make yourself sick to go to school each morning is NOT normal. Walking down hallways and having that itchy feeling that everyone is staring at you is NOT normal. Analyzing everything you say after it\u2019s already been said and beating yourself up about it is NOT normal. \n\nThere is a difference. The problem lies in misunderstanding and lack of empathy.",
    "Agreed. And the more it continues, the less help people with severe mental illness feel is theirs.",
    "Or when they do the whole \u2018trauma makes you funny\u2019 shit I just wanna slap them. Mental illness does not make you funny or interesting and there is also so much more to me than my trauma and my illness. I think a lot of young teenagers just want to be part of a group and feel understood and accepted, and sometimes they do that by self diagnosing themselves with 10 different mental illnesses and treating normal teenage behaviour as symptoms of those illnesses. It\u2019s just so insulting to people who actually suffer with these things",
    "Been seeing a lot of dumb teenagers doing that with cluster B personality disorders?? \"Ahahah I'm such a bpd tee-hee\"",
    "It's extraordinarily ignorant of people to assume that everyone's depression/anxiety is the same. They can't comprehend that other people can have different severity/duration/persistence of symptoms, or different experiences/issues/life stressors than them, so they dismiss and shut people down. If they want to keep plugging their ears and ignoring the reality of the existence and  spectrum of mental illness, then I don't have time for them and their thick-headed bullshit.",
    "As someone with diagnosed BPD I couldn\u2019t agree with this more. The amount of people who are like \u2018oop spent 2 hours on BPD tiktok and now I think I have it\u2019. Most people put out such misinformation about it, focussing mainly on our inability to form stable relationships and attachment issues. Most people don\u2019t realise everyone has a different attachment style and that alone doesn\u2019t mean you have BPD.\n\nIt\u2019s a condition that truly ruins my life, I\u2019m scared to tell people I have it. Ask my family about what it looks like when I have a breakdown, the ones I love have to watch me scream till my throat hurts and break stuff and hurt myself. I\u2019m nearly 21 but even I can\u2019t physically control myself sometimes. It feels embarrassing and I feel constantly guilty. It\u2019s unpredictable, it feels like my mind is working against me so seeing these kids talk about it like it\u2019s some cute character trait honestly just hurts.",
    "GOD YES. It\u2019s ridiculous, insulting and just plain cringe.",
    "yes!! it reminds me of like 2016 tumblr as it's so normalized but so toxic! there's a large part of tiktok that's just thinspo as well",

OCD is continually losing your job bc you can\u2019t even get out of your house bc u can\u2019t stop cleaning, or checking, or whatever compulsion. It\u2019s not cool or fun. And you don\u2019t have \u201ca little\u201d of it. It\u2019s devastating. And when ppl see what it ACTUALLY is... then suddenly you\u2019re \u201ccrazy.\u201d Like um, no. That\u2019s not crazy; that\u2019s OCD. Sorry to burst your little ignorant, privileged bubble.

    "Exactly, it makes it harder for non mentally ill people to take us seriously which is bad enough as it is, but it also normalizes it in a way that I think makes young mentally ill people think that their illness is normal and they don\u2019t need help. Don\u2019t even get me started on how they misuse \u201ctrauma\u201d bc they think it\u2019s funny and claim every little thing they do is a symptom of depression or anxiety. The worst part is that so many of those people judge actually mentally ill people for our less pleasant symptoms, like struggling with hygiene or being irritable.",

    "I definitely agree with your last paragraph. One thing I noticed is that when certain mental illnesses get normalized (let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s only depression and anxiety not things like bipolar/schizophrenia ) the downside is that everyone starts self diagnosing and identifying as that mental illness. It also becomes commodified",
    "Omfg thank you someone said it!!!! the amount of time\u2019s i\u2019ve seen fresh scars thinspo and incredibly triggering things and people saying your triggers arnt there responsibility. People trying to compete in who takes the most pills in an overdose. And self diagnosing like serious mental illnesses like bpd wtf that shit destroys ur life it ain\u2019t quirky or fun. People making people not feeling valid for not going to a mental hospital or something very extreme like that.",
    "Yep. It's true that most people have something wrong but that's not a reason to blow mental illness off as being not a big deal. Quite the opposite. It's a reason to look at the way we operate as a society, the way we treat each other and our attitudes towards mental health.",
    "We are victims of our own consciousness, our own realities and perspectives. Or rather, our lack thereof.",
    "I hate that, especially related to anxiety disorders. When you have crippling anxiety but it's not taken seriously because it's \"just anxiety, everyone has it\". It's not the same.",
    "As a teenager, I completely agree with you there. There\u2019s lots of kids out there wanting to fit in, and be unique, but it just gets taken to an extreme level. These people probably do have anxiety or depression or whatever problem, but it just gets blown off as common, so they look for more extreme things, and I think subconsciously, they\u2019re just looking for help. It\u2019s like how some little kids get hurt and they\u2019re scared, so they act like this tiny cut is the end of the world, when in reality, they\u2019re not dying, but they do need comfort. So try to be a bit more understanding, kids just get confused. We\u2019re still kids, even though we don\u2019t like to admit it, and some of us have overactive imaginations.",
    "people on tik tok also gatekeep mental illness it\u2019s so weird. or get angry at people even wondering if they have something. i don\u2019t think self diagnosis is inherently bad as it can be very hard and complex to get a diagnosis BUT self diagnosing from a tik tok video is wrong - you have to do ur research",
    "I hate to question people\u2019s mental health but seriously it\u2019s almost like tiktokers/SM in general will hear a new word and think they have it \n\nLike \u201chyperfixation\u201d was being talked about quite a lot on tiktok.  And I swear all these creators (not just teenagers) were convinced they had it.  Like you don\u2019t have \u201chyper fixation\u201d just because you become really interested in something.  That\u2019s normal.  And I remember I said this once (in a nice way) and the girl said \u201cno but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it\u201d but that\u2019s not unusual when you develop a new interest.  Especially since she was on live and she wasn\u2019t even hyper fixated on this thing, she talked about it once and then didn\u2019t mention it again\n\nIt\u2019s the same with maladaptive daydreaming.",

    "I have bipolar II disorder and, since getting a diagnosis, I\u2019ve learned so much more about it and know what it feels like. It pisses me off when people have mood swings and are like \u201cI\u2019m so bipolar.\u201d Like no Martha, bipolar is having so much energy for several days, weeks, or sometimes months were you have no impulse inhibition and feel like you\u2019re on the top of the world and then crashing and literally being unable to get out bed for days and almost committing yourself to a psych ward because you thought you were going crazy and might kill yourself. Talk to me about slicing up your arm because you found a blade and thought it would be fun and then about almost overdosing on pills to make you feel like that again.",

Sure it\u2019s annoying, attention-seeking, and most of all unhealthy but I\u2019m gonna reserve my ire for a culture and tech world that isolates humans from each other and discourages honesty and authenticity. I feel sorry for these kids that obviously just want to feel like they\u2019re a part of something, which is becoming increasingly difficult in our social media centered, proto-instrumentarian power ruled society. You could also take a macro step back and think of it as an expression of Hegel\u2019s antithesis. This could be a generational swing/overreaction to a history of forced silence regarding mental illness. You were supposed to shove that shit deep down and if you couldn\u2019t, you could get locked up for an indefinite amount of time. I\u2019m only 32 and I remember being treated like a pariah for my mental issues when I was a kid. Just remember, these kids aren\u2019t getting anything but hurt by this unfortunate social trend and I have way more spite for the Pharma and media companies encouraging overdiagnoses and the widespread pathologization of everyone.",

Yes it's comforting sometimes but when all that childhood trauma kicks in, all you want to do is curl into a ball and wither away.

    ">most of them are ... not even diagnosed\n\na counterpoint to this is how difficult it is to get diagnosed when you don't come from privilege. even in countries with socialized medicine, actually getting treated and diagnosed for your mental illness can be an incredibly involved process that involves wait periods and fumbling through beurocracy\n\nI was talking with my therapist about how I suspected having a couple of disorders I wasn't diagnosed with, but was able to treat the symptoms with methods I've learned for the ones I am diagnosed with. He told me that if I'm able to treat them effectively through existing therapy, then a diagnosis isn't really a necessary thing to pursue and I really think there's something to that. diagnosis is certainly a big \"valid\" stamp on your symptoms sure, but before that it's a tool for treatment and you first have to work out whether additional professional treatment is needed before you jump straight to that.\n\nfuck people claiming for clout, but I don't think you *need* a diagnosis to be valid in your claim of mental illness",

    "Exactly. Once signs of mental illnesses are a certain distance away from being socially acceptable, it\u2019s demonized. The \u201ccrackhead on the train talking to them self\u201d trope is an example. Those \u201ccrackheads\u201d probably have a mental illness that\u2019s being romanticized.",

This sentence is enough to make me have a breakdown, even if it's a complete stranger..\n\nBut I love how everyone advocates for mental health destigmatisation and pretends to be 'woke' (hate that word uhh) on social media or irl even, but when they actually MEET a person with serious problems, none of that tiktok bullshit, they quickly double down and cut all contact. If I had a dollar for every time I have experienced this, I'd probably have around 100 dollars right now.",

    "I do have ADHD...and bipolar 2, and I am so over ADHD TikTok like there are waaay too many people on the ADHD train. Like I follow a few actual psychiatrists that I really appreciate, but then there are just dozens and dozens of other people centering all their content on it. It just gets really redundant and lessens everyone\u2019s credibility due to just the sheer abundance of content centered around the exact same specific thing. I guess I\u2019ve learned a couple \u201cfun facts\u201d, but the main takeaway for me is how much I absolutely have no desire to talk about anything mental illness related on social media. Having it is tiring enough, and I don\u2019t want my identity online to revolve around this shit. Personally, I don\u2019t believe there is truly any hope in \u201cnormalizing\u201d mental illness, at least not literally. Acceptance and non-judgement towards people with mental illness is not the same as making changes or accommodations in the way businesses and society works, or on a personal level making small sacrifices or changing behavior to help a person with mental illness function better. This is perhaps too cynical of a view, but I think it\u2019s fairly realistic. Just based off predictive models of behavior,and my own experiences over the past decade of having a mental illness. Not that progress can\u2019t be made.",

I remember it being a thing back in like... 2008. Maybe I'm just underestimating the longevity of a trend, but perhaps this is just a part of teenagers seeking out their identity? Not that I think it's okay, mind you.",
    "I have diagnosed did and ngl your brother makes me beyond upset and mad. I was diagnosed at 15 (earlier than usual) because mine had become so severe they couldn't even try to ignore it because it easily could've become a threat to my health. Its painful to know people do this",

    "That sucks too because not all symptoms present the same of all disorders. And labels can be rather confining anyway. Personally I think there\u2019s a lot of overlap. Some symptoms of severe depression or mania can also be seen in schizophrenia. And it\u2019s no one\u2019s place to gaslight another person or minimize their experience. And honestly none of it even matters, bc it seems only the ones who have the money to afford proper care can get it. Who have the luxury of \u201cshopping around\u201d for a good fit, etc.",
    "Oh I am so sorry.. I am sure you've experienced so much and this new \"trend\" is just... Disgusting tbh.\n\nAs a friend of someone with BPD I'm sending good vibes your way!!",

    "honestly it's never pretty",
    "No, I completely understand that. It drives me insane to no end, especially being a person with mental and physical disabilities. I\u2019m just saying that I feel like there is a reason behind it, and I try to be patient with them. We need to start spreading more awareness for mental disorders/disabilities, and not just see it as a cute little quirk, you\u2019re definitely right there.",
    "exactly you have to be careful. i think internet culture has led to this idea of wanting to be different or like an underdog and so they see having a mental illness as making them edgy and different. mental illnesses aren\u2019t super rare tho so it\u2019s a bit silly",
    "Hate the word trigger. Not everyone with mental health issues has constant 'triggers'. Nothing triggers my depression or anxiety. Its bloody constant.",
    "I work a lot with teenagers, and I'm a total mental health advocate, but I have to say I have acceptes and appreciate the modern use of the word \"trigger\" now. I've come to understand it as young people's way of acknowledging when situations make them feel instantly overwhelmed by emotion. I think it's better for people to be acknowledging when they're overwhelmed by emotion, rather than previous generations' tendency to just pretend it isn't happening at all. Of course there are downsides and of course in minimizes what the word trigger means to someone with an emotional disorder, but I still feel like it's actually move in the right direction. I hope!",

Also yeah fuck that stupid \"Crazy ex\" or \"attention seeking\" stereotypes... AHHH sorry its honestly just annoying and I can only imagine how it is for someone with bpd (although my friend also hates it too lol)\n\nAlso also, thank you! I love the girl so much and its honestly been a journey with her and I'm glad she's in my life :)",
    "aaaaaaa you made my day honey i really appreciate you listening so much and am giving you a billion hugs!! yeah i do feel loved my partner now, he really embraces how emotional i am and its really lovely!!! i think it just takes a bit of time for people with disorders to figure out themselves to be able to find the people who will treat them right and embrace them! love your words and your heart, hoping youre having the most wonderful day/night! \ud83d\udc95",
    "Its definitely important to explore the meaning as long as we can find a way to help stop the misinfo",
    "I mean, you understand why though.. without a standard for diagnosis there are so many people who just guess what they \"have\" prematurely and then go around believing it which can be harmful to themselves, others, and those that actually have that disorder. Trying to privelege shame people that strive for accurate and progressional diagnoses is silly.",

I wish you both the best and I can tell you both love one another so so so much!\n\nI also hope I can be a loving and good influence on my best friend who has BPD, and hearing that I made your day shows that I'm doing something right by learning about BPD. So thank you :), I hope the rest of your day goes amazing!! <3",

I know I can tell the difference between my fianc\u00e9's footsteps and his dad's, and that's just after living with them for 2 years. Definitely haven't been abused my either one or my blood family for that matter lol.",
    "Ikr I\u2019ve dealt with abuse and I can identify my family\u2019s footsteps for the most part, but it\u2019s definitely NOT due to the abuse lmao\n\nThis is so weird lol like umm people have different weights/sizes and ways of walking so if you live w them long enough... I could identify my flatmates\u2019 footsteps... did my flatmates abuse me? Hmm lol",

You develop (insert any medical illness here) they understand, want to see how you are managing. Sometimes they help out. They know how to help you. It makes sense to them.\n\nYou get a mental illness and the responses are either not there, or weird and judgy. These days I just dont talk to people about it. Its too complicated the way its encountered. Even now. In 2020. When everyone is supposed to be so enlightened. Dont get me wrong - we have come a long way - but we still have such a long way to go before it can be freely discussed like any other illness without people either thinking you are some kind of failure or weirdo or whatever other current misunderstanding they are carrying to incorrectly tack onto your experience.\n\nIm really sorry you had a hard time. \n\nI guess the point of this is to emphasise to you how lucky you are to have people around who are getting it, or at least attempting to. Im so pleased for you and wish you a solid recovery going forward. It is possible. Remission is possible. A full life is possible.

Did you truelly understand the gravity of what it is to End your life?  I, for example, was not serious about taking my life... It was more like.. So many things were going wrong in my life, health, abuse etc.. It felt like that was it. My life came and was done. I was on severe insomnia attack.. 3 days in row I did not sleep. At one point, your view of reality.. Is like being on some drugs... I had this constant anxiety, I could not breath, as if I was on a chair.. Chained to it, could not move and the room was filling up with water... Up to my nose... I was convinced I was dying.. Not wanting to end my life, actually dying... And I took a whole bunch of sleeping pills because I just wanted to sleep through it.. Relax finally. Rest.. I think that pretty much sums it up.. Then I woke up, as I recall.. Realizing what I just did... All these pills.. By then I could not speak... Like my whole nervous system was depressed.. I, on my head screamed out God help me, please.... Then I remember being violent shaken in hospital... Yeah.. So we do need to talk about it. In order to prevent suicide we need to equipt the people that do want to help understanding what was going through your head... I wrote a 5 page journey to hell.. And back. Btw, what is your mental illness, that u were given diagnosis for anyway? And I'm glad you are still breathing, as I am! I have lots of trauma, anxiety, ptsd.. And that shit is real",

I got a call from a cousin of his that he hung himself.. That is the only reason why she was able to communicate with me. They let him out of jail because of covit last year, with the stipulation that there is a lifetime prohibition from any form of contact with me, by him or his family... I thought they just let him out on parole and was in part angry that he got out while I have to deal with all this pain.. Trauma, broken teeth that need rework.. I only recently stopped getting seasures due to scarring on my brain from the concussion I got when he hammered my had against the wall or used it as a boxing bag. I did not realize he did get a pretty harsh sentence. Sadly, only because of his death did I get to find out the truth. I'm still not sure how to process that. Got a call with my therapist tomorrow (today i guess, just realized it's 1 30 am est).. Boy, not sleepy at all.\nShe does not know about this recent event yet, should be an interesting conversation. I'm just realizing as I write this... It's a pattern with me, every time day before I speak with her, I cannot sleep. I guess anxiety takes over, knowing ill be dealing with it.",

But with Xanax my head is much clearer and I can articulate my words better, I also have more energy. Keep in mind that I am also on Pristiq and Wellbutrin so the combination therapy might be the reason for my symptoms. \n\nI\u2019ve learned the hard lesson to not mix it with alcohol as I turn into a giant asshole.

    "There's lots of other meds that you can try to help with sleep other than Xanax - there's other benzos and also sleep specific medicines so don't give up hope yet.",
    "Also known by its generic name Alprazolam, it\u2019s a prescription anti-anxiety drug that was widely used to treat an array of disorders including social phobia, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD. It belongs to a class of anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) drugs known as benzodiazepines or \u201cbenzos.\u201d Other benzos include Klonopin (clonazepam), Ativan (lorazepam) and Valium (diazepam.) \n\nXanax, while especially effective at reducing anxiety, also has a high risk for addiction and abuse. This is especially problematic because it can also cause kleptomania and blackouts when taken in high doses. I\u2019ve heard people joke that \u201cbinging on Xanax may be bad for you, but at least you get to wake up with a bunch of brand new shit you don\u2019t even remember stealing.\u201d\n\nFor this reason, many medical professionals nowadays seem to be hesitant to prescribe them, and when they do they tend to prefer Klonopin over Xanax given the fact that Klonopin has a longer half-life therefore a lower potential for addiction. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that Xanax is still a very popular prescription drug of abuse in the realm of illicit use. I mean, Xanax has made a name for itself in pop culture, whereas Klonopin and Ativan just aren\u2019t as sexy.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget that Xanax (as well as all benzos for that matter) can lead to very nasty withdrawal symptoms and can cause fatal respiratory failure when combined with alcohol.\n\nWhether you\u2019re experiencing anxiety due to an underlying mental health condition or just the stresses of everyday life, Xanax will obliterate all of those unpleasant feelings and leave you with a very pleasant and relaxing high for a time until it wears off. What happens afterwards is the issue, as is the issue with all powerful anxioltyic substances. Try to be informed as you can and stay safe out there.",

And it definitely can cause damage if misused.\n\nI guess I am lucky to never had the need to increased the dose",

I\u2019ve been trying to use weed to help my anxiety since I was a teenager, i\u2019ve tried all the ways you could think of, and at the end of the day I still end up having panic attacks and feeling like i\u2019m dying, or that i\u2019m not in reality, or that people are around me and watching me.

    "Being loved is not a personal choice. I read some comments below so i understand this is about how we push people away etc. Mental health is not what you do or don\u2019t decide. The human brain is literally 95-99% unconsciously driven. Everyone deserves to be loved and appreciated and if people don\u2019t it\u2019s not because you chose incorrectly. We really overemphasize the role of personal choice. Think about what I said earlier once again. 95-99% of the human brain is completely unconscious. That means it\u2019s inaccessible consciously. That means consciousness is literally like what it feels like to be you. It\u2019s not you. There is no \u201cyou\u201d in your own damn head. The concept of \u201cself\u201d is an illusion. Your brain is like a committee and it makes literally almost all of its decisions without your conscious awareness. Mental health is a societal problem. It\u2019s a social problem. It\u2019s a cultural problem. It\u2019s NOT an individual problem. People are mentally ill because they have unmet needs and unprocessed trauma and they are surrounded by people who abuse them",

Nor will any amount of people telling you you\u2019re enough change your perception if YOU dont already know it. Your feelings of worth are an inside job BPD, mental health issues or not.

    "I'm sorry if you've had a bad experience with this before. I hope you're doing well. I understand I could've worded my comment better; what I meant to say was more about the image being ambiguous, and the fact that I can see two ways to interpret the message, one really shitty and confusing and another that's actually something I can get behind and that also makes much more sense in the context (so I assumed that's what OP and the people who responded positively to the post read it as). That doesn't change the fact that it was worded very poorly and could have potentially harmful implications.\n\nI wrote my comment for that exact reason: to point out that the wording implies something potentially harmful that I strongly disagree with and feel that people really shouldn't internalize, and that there actually was a positive message to be found there, I just would have phrased it differently; I tried to specify what that positive message was because I didn't want people to see it and think: \"Oh, this image says my worth should be decided by other people, and many people upvoted it, so there must be some truth to that.\" Because no, that's false. But you should not decide *for* other people whether or not you're worth their time and affection - because even if you migh not believe it yourself, you do deserve that. And you also have to allow people to be there for you and love you, they can't do it if you don't let them. That is something I agree with and consider a healthy message.\n\nSure, maybe it's not what the author of this image intended. I personally believe that doesn't really matter in the end. The only important thing is what we read in it and what it means to *us* (and I feel like this is even more true with mental health, as everyone's experience is so different and unique and subjective). I fully subscribe to the concept of the Death of the Author - the reader is the one who ascribes the meaning to a text (or any other piece of media for that matter), the author's intention is ultimately inconsequential. But it's my opinion and you can disagree.\n\nI hope you have a good day, take care.",
    "Hey, I appreciate you taking the time to explain this to me and get me to pull my head out of my ass (not sarcasm). Wish I could bump this to the top myself.

    "Been there, it\u2019s agony. Im sorry you\u2019re going through it. \nAs others have said, it\u2019s okay to feel this way. There is nothing wrong with you and anyone who does have depression is likely having a harder time than usual given the state of the world.\n\nA couple approaches that have helped me personally (as someone who wanted to avoid anti depressants) no feel this way- \n- do something, anything, at any pace. Obviously, the depression makes you feel the opposite intensely, but I\u2019ve found that breaking it (incredibly hard to do) in any capacity has helped slowly but surely loosen depresssions grip. \n- part of the above, keep moving. No matter how small the effort (maybe it\u2019s sitting up instead of curling in a depression ball) keep moving and building that inner strength. Anything is a positive impact and hopefully you can keep building. \n- try to muster the energy to meditate. There\u2019s many guided meditations on YouTube, Spotify, and of course specific apps. If you\u2019re with kaiser, calm app is free. It really helps center your mind. R/meditate is a good resource also. \n- exercise if you can. This one is so, SO hard in depression. But the pay off is huge. Even just stretching is again a step in the right direction. \n\nI hope any of these could be helpful but understand depression hits everyone differently and they may not. \nNo matter how your journey manifests I truly hope things get better for you.",

    "If you want the specific symptoms of a panic attack or panic disorder, I would consult a profession or refer to the DSM-V.

I happen to own a DSM because I\u2019m in school for social work (not trying time appear like an expert, but I have some knowledge). In a nutshell, most of the symptoms for a \u201cpanic attack\u201d listed in the DSM are physiological symptoms like rapid heartbeat, etc. \n\nI could see the symptoms from OP\u2019s post describing more generalized anxiety, but it\u2019s still rather anecdotal compared to the DSM. Yikes this reply is getting long, but the DSM is seen as the psychiatric bible. There is some bias, as with everything and should also be taken with a grain of salt, but professionally it is regarded as truth. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a professional MH provider in the US, I believe NAMI and SAMHSA have provider locators on their websites. If you\u2019re in a rural area, they may have resources for telehealth. Hope this helps some. Hang in there.",

I don't feel like reliving every past trauma to fill a new therapist in. I think it's in everyone's best interest to try a therapist or psychiatrist but if it's not working then teach yourself some healthy coping skills. My psychiatrist had me on 8 different medications, 4 of which were experimental, and all they did was mess me up more. If medication and therapy work for you then great that's awesome. But having gone through the system multiple times I can safely say it's not for me and frankly it's messed up when people say \"You need meds, that's the only way you're gonna get better\" when medication and therapy isn't for everyone.",

    "My ex of 5 years let my family and I take him in for the entirety of our relationship. My mother took him away from his abusive family and even got a power of attorney over him. She dealt with CPS on his behalf to allow him to legally stay with us given the fact that we were minors at the time. We were together from ages 16-21ish. My mom went thru so much. He even called her mom and they were extremely close. We got him clean off of drugs and even got him into college where he earned his degree. I left to do a Disney internship and 2 weeks before Christmas and before i was about to come home, he broke up with me via text message. He continued crashing with us for another couple of months because my mom and i were still so confused as to what to do considering he was basically family at that point. But it turns out he'd been sneaking around for the past few weeks with some other girl, so much so that he would have her park around the corner so that he could say he was leaving and he could get to her without anyone seeing. Once he was finally out of our place for good he stayed with that girl for another year or so, and has since been bouncing around from girl to girl and has also let the drugs back into his life again. Once he moved out he also tried to turn all of our mutual friends against me by spreading malicious lies about my family and i. This was years ago now at this point, but to this day we still don't know why he snapped and did what he did. Within the span of about 2 weeks he was a completely different person than he had been ever since we'd known him. My family and i wanted to maintain a mature relationship with him even if him and i had been broken up since we'd all been thru so much together over the years, we just assumed he'd always be family. He clearly had other plans. Since I've had time to go over it so many times, I've come to the conclusion that he never loved me or my mother and he was just using us for as long as he possibly could to gain as much as he could before he would eventually split. I believe he's a sociopath with no conscience. He is a great actor. I still see him around from time to time because of our mutual circle of friends, but i gave up long ago trying to understand him. We just had to accept the simple fact that we were used up until we had nothing left to give and he had gained everything he possibly could from us, and then he simply ran away. It took us years to recover and i think my mom still has issues considering she thought of him as a son for all those years. And he is now just moving from girl to girl while partying his way thru life. I have a shitty night every time i run into him.",

They will die, and it doesn't matter what wealth they've accumulated, what kind of lives they've had, if they had profound changes to the way they act and feel, or if they're alone in a shack bitter that they lost everything.\n\n*Everyone* dies alone. Coughing, gasping, shitting themselves. There's no dignity in it and everyone is terrified. \n\nWhile grim, it should also be your great lesson in living in the moment. The difference between you and them, is you have right now, in this very instant, the choice to decide to live in a moment without regret and continue living in those moments through the rest of your life. You can make a moment stretch on forever. \n\nIt takes some work and practice though.

People that don't deserve to be in your life will not be in your life. It's their loss, it's because of their choices.   \n\n\nI'm going to tell you a story.  There was this person that I considered a good friend in college. He tried scamming me with those pyramid schemes, I didn't get scammed. I was really really nice to him in college, and even till the point he tried scamming me. When I was approached, I figured I'd check it out, and I was just going to talk and find out what's up. When I told my brother and my parents, they said it sounded fishy, and although I thought it was like that as well, as the guys I spoke to seemed that way, I thought the person I considered my friend would never do that to me. I gave him every single benefit of the doubt, and he had lied to me to my face. I did some research and found out which company they were from, and I found out that it was a scam. I felt really bad that he did that that time, and I vented to my friends for 3 days. But I'm extremely grateful that it happened because I genuinely cared about him till that point, and I found out he was unworthy of friendship and loyalty. Friendship and loyalty are extremely important to me! The universe was helping me see that person's true colors, and I'm happy that everything that's ever happened to me happened to me, you know? Everything that's happened makes me who I am.  \n\n\nYou're perfect the way you are! We should always accept ourselves for who we are. If there's something you don't like about yourself, you can change it, but only for yourself, not for others. Others should accept you for who you are! You should accept others for who they are as well! :) Always be okay with seeing a person's true colors, good or bad! :) Whoever is meant to stay in your life will, and whoever isn't will not! :)  \n\n\nAs for what you're going through, when things are hard, we grow! Perhaps what we're meant to do, we will do better with what we learn from the times we're suffering! Perhaps you're meant to start a company, and you think of an idea because you're going through this.  \n\n\nLet me tell you something, each and every single vibration influences the course of the timeline. Even if one single thing was different, we wouldn't be here! So perhaps, this was meant to happen so that you'd meet a special someone that you're meant to be with! You never know! We're not supposed to know everything beforehand! What's meant to happen will happen! :) What we can do, is be ourselves, and have the right intentions from our side! :)   \n\n\nKarma is a teacher! The universe will make sure they understand that it wasn't okay to do what they did! :)  \n\n\nYou have a purpose, and that purpose is fulfilled by you being yourself! :) You're one in seven billion! You're perfect the way you are! :)  \n\n\nYou said that you were suicidal. I'm here if you ever need someone to talk to! :) I want to say is, life's about being happy. If you're depressed, I really think you should take a break, and try to connect to yourself. Try to understand why you feel what you feel! Try to understand what you want from life! Connect to yourself! It might be scary at first, but just because it's hard and scary doesn't mean it's bad, you know? It's like untying a knot! Talk to your mind! :)\n\nIf your job is toxic to you, you should quit! You're allowed to not want to be near people that affect you negatively! You're allowed to not do things you don't like! To eventually become happy, it's about getting into a neutral state of mind! Once you reach that, you'll be able to get to a state where you're happy all the time!\n\nEmotions are very important, and it's important to not suppress them, or avoid them! They can exhaust you, and be a weight on your chest as well! It's important to stay connected to them! Your heart doesn't lie to you! :) Listen to it! :)\n\nLife's about being happy, and doing what you love! Life's about having fun, and spending time with your loved ones! Life's about finding out what you're passionate about, and doing it! You're one in seven billion! You're perfect the way you are! Everyone's great at something, and everyone can be great at something if they do what it takes! Everyone is a genius in their own way! If you haven't found out what you're passionate about, keep looking! Here's the thing, people love watching passionate people do their thing! Whether it's streaming games, or singing, or whatever! Do something you want to do in life! Follow your passion! Follow your heart! If you do what you're passionate about, everyday, when you wake up, you'll embrace the day instead of going \"Ugh, I have to work today\", you know? It might not be sunshine and rainbows all the time, but it's something you want!\n\nLife is like a marathon! It's about the journey, and not the destination! You run for yourself, you run with your friends and family, and eventually, you'll find someone that you want to run the rest of your life with! ;) Do what you want to do! :)  \n\n\nIt's important to understand that there are things out of our control, and one shouldn't worry about things that we can't do anything about! What we do have control over, we can do something, so we shouldn't worry as much! :)\n\nI really wish this helped! :) I am your friend! I'm here if you need someone to talk to! :) Take care! :)",

    "Trauma. One simple phrase people have out played and over used in ways it shouldn't have ever been and now people question its truth. For generations we have built trauma and shaped it into what we need it to be to fit. So being older and trying to problem solve for the helpless adults in ones life came easy, because they were helpless, or still are, but nonetheless it has been a cycle one way or another. Responses to kindling fears and past actions and situations that one was put through. Some cant handle it and their mind consumes them when in reality its a defense mechanism for survival. Thats all human nature has ever been and will ever be, adaptations for survival. Whatever we get exposed to we have to figure out a way to protect ourselves. Everyone is different. Thats what makes us all unique. The science behind it all is crazy because we have studied it in every other animal. Humans are no different, except with consciousness and the ability of self recognition humans are advanced enough to prefect efficient survival tactics if people actually took it more seriously.\nIn a nutshell, every cause has an affect. Any response that triggers the nerve receptors in your brain to go off good or bad yields that effect. Whatever makes that response happen is the cause. No matter what happens it will always result in some kind of effect.",

    "I have a mix of reactions from people. Mostly positive, however I've come across other traumatised people who I can only describe as being jealous. \n\nI've been called a psycho for being open. Bombarded with victim blaming and sly digs about the fact I'm in therapy. Such as \"A, B and C happened to me and I don't need fucking therapy\" like? Yes you do, Sandra. A,b and C are very traumatising experiences and the fact you're so mad that I am in therapy tells me you feel like you need it too and are feeling sadness that you don't receive help too so you're projecting.  \n\nI'm dealing with it young because I've had therapy since I was 7 years old! it's because I exhibited extreme symptoms early on and because I'm physically disabled and already was receiving care from specialists. All it took for them was a referral. I was in a position where I could get help. I'm not lucky for it, I was only in that position because I got an infection as a baby that ate my hip and femur. I'm sick to death of being called lucky for being so unwell. \n\nI'm 21 and I've been in therapy most of my life. It's taken me 10 years to actually be open about my trauma. Mostly because during those 10 years I was still stuck in traumatising situations most of the time and the past 2 years has been the first time I've been in a position where I am safe to speak about what happened to me! \n\nI'm not mature, I'm just emotionally aware. I wouldn't even call it emotional intelligence because I'm only smart and able to help when its somebody else's problem. I have a mental illness, I've had it since i was little so I'm obviously gonna feel relatively comfortable talking about it. \n\nThe worst for me? Being called an attention seeker. The only attention i seek is a spotlight on mental illness and the impact it has on our kids. I don't want other people going through what I did, and I try to relate when I hear a horrible story. This seems attention seeking but really I just want people to feel less alone. I've felt isolated and alone my entire life and I just want people to know that others have been hurt and that they aren't on their own with the feelings that hurt provokes. \n\nIdk. Mental health is so hard to advocate because of dumb archaic social rules about not speaking of unsavory things. I say fuck that because the hurt goes on behind closed doors and will only end when that door is opened.",

I had come to the reality that I had never come to full terms with and that I was just holding it in for such a long time and I felt so incredibly vulnerable and it was at the moment right there I knew I need to accept more help and reach out to therapy, but I had ALWAYS told myself that I was just mature for my age\u2026 I wasn\u2019t mature I was handing things and dealing with things I had no business handling and that type of mindset and habits has stayed with me forever..

    "Hopefully it gets better as I age. Definitely gets in the way of my life being depressed/sleep during the day and only having energy at night.",
    "Same!!",
    "What do you do to get some sleep? Since there\u2019s nobody else awake it\u2019s super annoying. I don\u2019t want to stop the manic high so it\u2019s really hard to take my meds and just go to sleep I guess I don\u2019t have enough willpower",
    "I used to do a lot of that too. People with mental illness are prone to it. :/",
    "No (bipolar 1 diagnosed 10+ years) but adderall and xanax can interrupt normal sleeping patterns.",

    "It'll take some days... Even could take some weeks or so(which happened in my case). Make your room super dark. Not a single beam of light. Not even the flashing lights of router or anything. Make your room completely dark and just stare at the ceiling with eyes open. Idk if it helps you, but in my case, I would just stare at the ceiling and it's complete darkness and I don't even know when I fell asleep. But it took me weeks to make tiny adjustments around my room to get it completely dark and get used to staring at the ceiling. And most importantly, turn every single devices down. Be it smartwatch, smartphone, laptop or anything. Put them away before you go to bed 30 mins ago. And, try to go to bed around 12 am or so. Or, you can try to sleep at your usual time and slowly bring it forward (which I did). And try to play some classic music, not hip-hop or pop kind. Try to find some classic music to relax and play it in very low volume. Just enough to listen to it. And again, the main thing is \"try to relax\". It'll take some time to get used to. But hopefully you'll be used to it.\n\nIdk if it's gonna work for u, but personally I got used to sleep like this. Else, before I'd stay awake till 7-8 in the morning. Just wouldn't be able to sleep.\n\nOhh... And, try some workout. That'll make u exhausted to get a better sleep.\n\nAnd, if you ever need any help, or feel awkward to talk to someone, do shoot me dm anytime you want. There's nothing awkward to not have sleeping issues.",
    "Why do I have to clarify that it\u2019s hypomania I can edit my comment if you want me to be so specific. Anyway my point is this is a relatable post and I just wanted to know if fellow bipolar people deal with the same boost of energy in the middle of the night since I have dealt with this my entire life. And yes I have hypomania",

    "I am very educated on mental illness I know this. Yes they are two very different things hypomania is definitely the less extreme but it is still debilitating especially the depression side of it.",
    "it can display very similar symptoms to full on mania. It may just not be as extreme. I have been hospitalized four times mentally for depressive episodes so.",
    "If you're very educated, then why did you not specify in your post? And you can't be up in the middle of the night and randomly become manic.",
    "I'm not at all taking away the legitimacy of hypomania. where did I say that? if your point was to be relatable, being accurate certainly would be helpful. there are a lot of people on reddit also 'very educated on mental illness'",
    "it's very strange to me that you are trying to act like mental illness is a competition. if you really want to play this game, I've been hospitalized 18 times involuntarily. diagnosed bipolar 1 and BPD for over 8 years. I am also working on a certification in counseling after finishing a bachelor's in psychology last year. I currently work at a university hospital. I am also a recovering heroin addict. I am no stranger to mental illness. and nothing I said delegitimized the effects of hypomania or bipolar II. that is an argument you started on your own, with yourself. mania and hypomania can BOTH be debilitating BUT, there is a difference between the two. which is all I'm saying. there's a difference. not 'one is worse than the other' just that they are not the same thing.",
    "I thought mania means being in the middle of a manic state.",
    "Yes relatable to the extent that people with regular mania and hypomania bipolar one bipolar 2 it doesn\u2019t matter can relate to staying up late during a manic episode or having hypomania. I\u2019ll have you know I am educated on mental illness it\u2019s some thing I\u2019m very passionate about and have dealt with my entire life.",
    "I am not trying to condone to the trend of mental illness because I would never wish it upon anyone. Having bipolar is hell and I would not wish it upon my worst enemy. the trauma and deaths I\u2019ve had to deal with due to substance-abuse and mental illness in my family.",
    "I was thinking the exact same thing! Since when did mental illnesses become competitive? I also have bipolar disorder and a few other diagnosed mental illnesses and have been hospitalized many times but I don't go around telling people about it! Only my family knows.",
    "I\u2019m a little confused by what you\u2019re saying because yes mania is mania. All I\u2019m saying is that you can\u2019t just be up at night and then randomly be manic at 3am. I have bipolar disorder. I know what mania is and feels like. It\u2019s more than just staying up late one night. And I know a sleep schedule is very important because it can mess with your moods. But last night I was up til 3am and I know I\u2019m not manic. I was just anxious and scrolling through my phone for hours.",
    "just know you are not alone and there are a lot of us out here trying just as hard as you to alleviate the stigma and educate others on the effects of mental illness. all I'm saying is accuracy is important. have a good night and try to get some sleep, even if it's difficult. you're not alone and you don't have to go through this alone.",
    "Same here. I really want to delete my comment but I feel like it adds context to the point I was trying to make. Nobody in the world should be acting or thinking that they know everything, especially about mental illness bc it\u2019s so specific per person and situation. And once you open that door it\u2019s always going to be \u2018who\u2019s trauma is worse than who\u2019s\u2019 which is entirely unfair and quite infuriating imo. We\u2019re all strangers here, we all have trauma and experiences, you don\u2019t know who could be lurking. It\u2019s better to stay humble about it. Yet at the same time I can\u2019t be mad at OP about it bc their responses are entirely descriptive of somebody going through hypomania. And I empathize with them\n\nEdit: and honestly I cringe even about what I stated in my comment above about my personal life. Just the fact that it\u2019s up there, I want to take it back but I\u2019m not going to dirty delete",

I forced myself to therapy, I forced myself to talk nicely to myself, I forced myself to take the right steps and I was unhappy about them all because I genuinely didn\u2019t want help. It\u2019s not always their fault if they don\u2019t want help, they might just be too sick to want happiness again, like I was.",

    "You\u2019re anxious over a doctor\u2019s appointment, and anxious that you won\u2019t have anything wrong with you.  Assuming you mean mental illness, regardless of a diagnosis you\u2019re valid. \n\nI was diagnosed at 14, and have been depressed, had OCD, anxiety, and anger issues. I now have a personality disorder and PTSD as well.  \n\nThe reason that is important, is to know that I understand diagnoses as much as someone who isn\u2019t a doctor can. You have some sort of issue that is really distressing you. Even if they don\u2019t diagnose you immidiately, it doesn\u2019t invalidate you.  My psychiatrist said I had BPD, but didn\u2019t officially diagnose and got me in programs so that I could maybe grow out of it, which is incredibly rare. Also, I am ALWAYS convinced that I have nothing wrong and am manipulating my psychiatrist that has known me since I was 14. I still feel like there is nothing wrong, that its fooling people (ah yes, fooling medical professionals that have done that for years or decades), that I\u2019m lazy, or an awful person. My therapist sat me down and we looked up my diagnoses in the DSM 5. I still feel like a faker, and by your definition, there is a lot \u201cwrong\u201d with me. If they do not take you seriously you NEED to see somebody else. \n\nWe don\u2019t gate keep mental illness. DM me if you need to talk about it.",

    "I\u2019ve tried in the past but they told my parents anyway. The counselors are a bit iffy on that part which is why I\u2019ve never opened up to anyone. I will give it a shot (if my anxiety allows it). Thanks for the advice!",

Maybe that will wake your parents up to realize what\u2019s hurting you and start being by your side not against you (in my opinion all strict parents are putting themselves against their kid as if their kid was a hell-spawn since it was born and I\u2019d bet they\u2019re a big part of the reason your mental health isn\u2019t in a good condition yet I don\u2019t mean to offend anyone) \nI hope that one way or another it will work out for you and you\u2019ll get the help you need!",

But with Schizoaffective disorders it\u2019s all poorly portrayed movies or stories that give the completely wrong impression. This makes the general public uneducated and even like hospital workers reacting poorly. It\u2019s so taboo...

    "Eating disorders aren\u2019t based on weight they\u2019re mental disorders. To tell someone who has most or all symptoms of anorexia but isn\u2019t underweight that they don\u2019t really have anorexia because they \u201cweigh too much\u201d is extremely invalidating. Yes, this was even done by medical professionals and still is a lot but it\u2019s stupid. I know people who have binged and purged a lot. But if they are underweight they first get diagnosed with anorexia just because theyre underweight. And if they get to a normal weight it changes to bulimia when they should\u2019ve been diagnosed with it from the beginning. That\u2019s part of the reason this is a harmful idea. People are wrongly diagnosed because of what they weigh rather than a diagnosis being based on the disordered behaviours. Because of this, some people don\u2019t get the proper help they need because doctors don\u2019t listen to them. And many people are too afraid to ask for help because they will likely be invalidated by stupid doctors who don\u2019t think they are \u201csick enough\u201d because they don\u2019t look like Eugenia Cooney or whatever. People also often don\u2019t care as much about people whom are overweight with an eating disorder. I have bulimia. I\u2019m not underweight. People often encourage me to lose weight even if they KNOW how I\u2019m losing it. People also kind of ignore that there is anything wrong with me because obviously I\u2019m not skinny so how could I have an eating disorder? It\u2019s harmful to me and others who face similar treatment. I do think ednos exists, however anorexia is anorexia no matter what weight you are. I also disagree with calling it atypical anorexia with normal/overweight people. Again, harmful and extremely invalidating. The behaviours are the same so why should the diagnosis change. This LITERALLY hurts people physically, emotionally, mentally, and I cannot stress that enough. I guess I should say I\u2019m sorry for this huge paragraph but I\u2019m really not, people need to be educated on their false beliefs that harm others.",

I'm just thinking about one of my clients. She's so depressed, and the stairs from her apartment seem so endless and daunting so she doesn't leave much.

However, I held it together and made it to my session. About 5 minutes in, my T asked if there was anything on my mind. I completely broke down and everything came spilling out; the suicidal thoughts, the severe anxiety, and how I had reached my limit. I was crying hysterically and could not not catch my breath or control myself. My T stared at me in silence for about a minute and then asked if she could sit next to me. She sat right by me, took both of my hands, and I realized she had tears in her eyes. She began to cry, and apologized for not realizing the severity of my depression and expressed sympathy for my pain.

Nope. That sounds real normal. \n\n\"But I want to have sex with my therapist, and that's weird.\" Is it, though?

Yeah, me too. \n\n\"But when my therapist goes on vacation I think about them and I'm sad and that's...\" Don't even say it. \n\n**Therapy relationships are relationships. Therapists are people. We're going to** ***feel*** **things, friends. And I think we could be a little kinder to ourselves about how legit and totally ok those feelings are.** \n\nWe know our therapists feel stuff, too.

My anxiety loves to fill my head with reasons as to why someone is late and it often gets me to the thought that they could have died. This time it was actually true. I called my therapist and I got a weird and quiet answer from someone else who sort of sounded like him. He asked who I was, I told him and asked for my therapist, saying that this was his clinical phone number that was posted on his website. He told me that he was his cousin and he regretfully had to inform me that my therapist has died. I was and still am in complete disbelief. This doesn't feel real. I have had a few therapists before, but this one has been my most favourite and comforting and effective therapist. We had just begun doing EMDR session to treat my past traumas, but I've been working with him for nearly a year now. He has always made sure that I feel heard and that everything I tell him was safe with him. He always made me feel appreciated. He even made personalized audio recordings for mindfulness meditations that I could do between our sessions. He has provided me with free sessions because I am so in debt from a series of concussion injuries over the past 5 years. I love this person and their counselling has changed my life immensely in the time that we had together. I am shattered to know that he took his own life. I imagine the weight of all that he was carrying and all that he wanted to do felt like it was too much. He was on a mission to help as many people with their traumas so that they could live with less pain. He has done that for me, and I can't believe his part in my journey has come to such an abrupt and unexpected end. My heart aches and I feel broken right now. (Please know that I do feel safe though, I am so fortunate to have a supportive partner and I will seek other counseling when I feel ready). \n\nThis seems like such an uncommon event, so I turn to you all to ask if anyone can relate. Has this happened to anyone here before? If you feel like you are able, can you share some of your experience with me? What did you do after you found out? How did you cope? What helped you make it through and what didn't? Any support is so greatly appreciated.",

    "Your therapist might care a lot more than you think\u2014mine disclosed so during termination",
    "Long but hopefully helpful/relatable. Yesterday, I had my termination session with my previous therapist of over a year. I was constantly terrified she was ready to ax me, and despite the fact that we talked about that fear, I still convinced myself to just end things and start with someone new. I mourned for weeks.\n\nTo my surprise, in our last session she actually shared that working with me was like \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d and that our connection was genuine. She admitted to processing, in her own time, the heavier things I shared\u2014that she didn\u2019t just walk away from the emotional bombs I dropped robotically and that she really cared. It was a huge relief to know that sometimes the vulnerable things we share stick with our therapists and they do their own processing with them. Hearing that made me feel incredibly grateful and humbled to know I wasn\u2019t as alone in dealing with the weight of those secrets. \n\nThere was only so much she could share within the treatment framework without triggering my feelings of being a burden, but in that moment I *really* needed to hear that our work mattered to her on a personal level. The thing that nearly broke me was hearing her voice soften as she said, encouragingly\u2014and almost sadly: \u201cAlien, not everyone in your life is going to leave you.\u201d \n\nIt was such a loaded statement because she knew why I terminated. I understood it as her way of saying, \u201c*I was not going to abandon you*\u201d. \n\nIt was an overarching theme to the session. She asked me to trust that people will stick around if I will allow it. The subtext was deafening. Our relationship, as we both had anticipated, was culminating into the same defensive pattern that I had followed my whole life: ending my relationships before they could end me. \n\nIn earlier sessions she revealed hopes that this treatment might model a new and healthier path for me (I\u2019m really sorry that it didn\u2019t). Yet, she still found a graceful way to investigate the fear behind my decision without making me feel ashamed or judged. Thanking me for my honesty and vulnerability, she reassured me that the way this played out was *okay*. She thought I ultimately used good judgment in deciding to work with a more specialized therapist who I could learn to trust the same. \n\nShe set the bar really fucking high for all of my future therapists\u2014my life is so much better having met her, mainly because she first validated my trauma and also fostered my very first safe space where I got to process a lot of \u2018forbidden\u2019 emotions I had never admitted to anyone before. I appreciated that she left the door open for me to drop in again, despite not offering to continue contact with other former clients. My heart is full, I have so much gratitude, and I hope that others with strong attachments to their therapists can feel safe enough to trust that not all of them are actively trying to get rid of us.",

    "My psychologist ghosted me to teach me a lesson.",
    "I had seen this psychologist 11 times over the course of about 8 months in 2019/2020. He was consistently late to every session (both in-person and virtual) but always prompt about ending the session on time which bugged me but, since it was just a matter of a few minutes, I tolerated it.\n\nOur last session was a virtual one in September 2020. I logged in five minutes before the start time and waited. After I had been waiting for 17 minutes (at which point he was 12 minutes late) I got fed up and decided I was sick of his tardiness, so I closed the browser and no-showed. To be clear, I still paid for this session even though I did not attend it. \n\nFast forward to two weeks ago. I've been really struggling and having a hard time finding another doctor, so I decided to give him another shot. I made an appointment (he has switched back to in-person sessions) and texted him the day before to confirm.\n\nThe next morning, I showed up but his office was locked and the lights were off. I called him, no answer. I texted, no response. Nothing. I instantly had a feeling like I had been ghosted, but constant feelings of abandonment are common with my condition so I tried to put that thought out of my mind. I tried to remind myself that he's a professional, that it makes no sense for a *psychologist* of all people would resort to that kind of petty tit-for-tat...and decided instead to assume he was dealing with a personal emergency and would get back to me when he could. \n\nFast forward again to yesterday. It had been 16 days since the scheduled appointment and I'd not heard anything from him until he called me and \\~very kindly\\~ left a voicemail saying he would be happy to start fresh if I had learned to respect other people's time, and if that was the case then I was welcome to book another appointment with him. \n\nI mean. I just. Wow.\n\nOn the one hand, he's got a point, I shouldn't have no-showed and I had even been planning to apologize and explain my reasoning during the session *he* no-showed for. On the other hand, it wasn't exactly a waste of his time - he was conducting virtual sessions from his home. It's not like he got up, got dressed, and drove to the office only to be stood up - *as I had.* And he was still paid for the session just the same as if I had shown up. Forgive me for saying it, but our no-shows were not the same. \n\nSo I declined the offer. I'm not interested in seeing a psychologist who engages in exactly the kind of retaliatory behavior that I'm trying to fix in myself. \n\nI don't really know where I'm going with this post.

I think it\u2019s mainly because she deals with cptsd and dissociative disorders so most of her clients are more likely to end up in a crisis.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly super therapeutic to have this option.

    "Being open and honest about your problems and struggles is most of the hard work of therapy. Its figuring out what is causing you to self sabotage or whatever and then kicking that habit or finding ways to combat it. Therapists meet you where you are and encourage you, so if they can tell it is hard for you to talk about things but you do it anyway that's pretty awesome! May not seem like \"good work\" to us, but it IS good work and the majority of us are awfully cruel to ourselves so I wouldnt really trust my own self assessment anyway.",

    "As a therapist, one of the first lessons I was taught is to prepare for closure from the first sessy, because therapy, by it's nature, is temporary.  In other words, part of my job to prepare my client for life without me, meaning they must learn to find supports outside of therapy. I am frequently asked if a theraputic relationship can \"downshift\" into a friendship.  Again, I explain the temporary nature of the relationship, and how I wouldn't want any ambiguity to hurt them, but, selfishly, there are many who I would love to stay friends with, because so many of my clients are phenomenal people.\n\nA few years ago, in an ethics training, the trainer asked me if I ran into a client at the grocery store after ten years had passed, and they asked me to get a cup of coffee, would that be unethical? I said I guess not.  So, here's hoping i run into one of those past clients in the grocery store one day.",

    "Hey man, as someone coming from a manipulative family, the way your therapist responded raises some serious red flags. You shouldn\u2019t be shut up in therapy, it\u2019s completely antithetical to the purpose of it. You should never be made to feel that way, in life in general, but especially from a goddamn professional. I\u2019m obviously not privy to to the details of your exact situation, but it sounds like your T completely failed to validate your feelings, a subject on which you are the expert, and suggested some sort of false equivalency. Sure, maybe your mom was a better parent than your grandma was to her, but that doesn\u2019t fucking matter. Your mother isn\u2019t the one coming to therapy. Your therapist is literally defending your mother over you. Wow just, I can\u2019t even. Dump that therapist ASAP",
    "I feel your pain dude. It's the gift that keeps on giving.",
    "woah, little harsh coming from someone who is completely uneducated on me and my therapist\u2019s relationship. first, i more said she shut me up in a joking way, like that she made a good point. i often feel unloved by my mom and it\u2019s nice when my therapist can pull me out of that headspace and remind me of the things she does that show me she does love me. i have the ability to speak up for myself, ESPECIALLY in therapy. if i felt like my therapist was defending my mom instead of me i would 100% tell her i feel that way. i think this instance was really situational and in general my therapist has never not validated and empathized with my feelings. i appreciate you looking out and maybe i\u2019ll even bring this up to her.",

It literally pained me to read \"well your mom isn't so bad because X is worse\". And these types of therapists totally exist. I am relieved to learn that your therapist was just making light of the situation, and that you have the sort of relationship in which a little humor works for you.",

I've really appreciated the patience my T has given. It's allowed me open up to him more, and he can understand me a little bit better. And sometimes it is what it is too, and I would let him know.\n\nEdit: grammar",

I never really thought about it being me dismissing myself, but that also makes a lot of sense for me.

I've been doing a lot of reading and thinking about things. I see another T as well and requested an extra session (which we had yesterday morning) because I've been realizing I experienced emotional neglect. The anniversary of my mom's death (holy crap seven years) is on Wednesday and I was worried we wouldn't talk about the emotional neglect stuff since I might be thinking about my mom too much and want to talk about her. We will be meeting that day (it's our usual day) and I'm praying Eyebrows has a cancellation that day because I really want to talk to them both.\n\nAnyway, since thinking about and realizing I've experienced CEN therapy has felt so much more daunting. That's going to be a lot to unravel and I'm tired already. I'm going to tell him how hard it seems and that I'm scared. I'm also going to start journaling after each session so I can remember what we talked about and how I felt about that session after it. I guess we are going to have to talk ABOUT therapy a lot IN therapy which is probably going to be annoying but hopefully insightful so we can both be sure I'm getting what I need from our sessions.",

I\u2019m pretty sure I have adhd.\n\nIve also started keeping a reflection journal and a thought journal. These remind me of my earlier thoughts and I get to explore them/map them out.

Then, in the evening, of get out my journal and physically write out those notes.\n\nIt really helped me because 1) I was able to get those thoughts and fears out of my head and 2) Going back to them helped me reevaluate those feelings and expound on them if necessary.",

My other T is good too (and more experienced), but often during sessions he will say stuff like \"Did I just say that to a client?\" Or \"I shouldn't say this, but...\" so far it hasn't been anything I see as really out of line for therapy but I do kind of worry one day he will say something I dont find appropriate or something and we will have a rupture.",

If I\u2019m feeling sad, it\u2019s a lot easier to talk/think around the sadness than to just sit and feel it. The speed of my thoughts dull the sharpness of the emotions.

    "with most insurance companies, your session is actually 53 minutes (if your therapist says it is one hour). if you ask them, they will kindly tell you this. it\u2019s so different in person, because clients aren\u2019t in the actual waiting room noticing their session starting 2-7 minutes late, since it\u2019s not actually very much time. it seems like more when you, the client, is trying so hard to precisely be in the meeting/link at the exact time and then you wait for your therapist - the opposite of how it is in person. i always say \u201callow me around 5 mins before or after your session to transition between clients,\u201d in intake sessions now, but didn\u2019t realize my clients who i saw in person for years didn\u2019t get the same disclaimer. it seems like a long time when you are staring at a digital clock watching each minute pass and waiting. clients are typically super understanding when i give them the disclaimer and usually say something about of course i have to go to the bathroom, get water, etc. in between sessions like normal/in office and i only have had one person actually check with their insurance company about the 53 minutes lol.",

    "Of course, without a doubt!\nWhat I tried to say is that if there's a mistake and the therapist got late, it's just that and nothing more. Because if they don't care, that means that they're unprofessional.",
    "Assuming you are a therapist, what do you do to do that?",
    "damn! really? i wish i had better boundaries with my time like that, but i feel like i\u2019m never done with anyone even in 60 minutes and always give more of my time! it is a little bit hard, because of the client arrives more than 7 mins late we should all change the cpt code, and could be paid less. but if you were less than like 10 minutes late, i wonder what was up. she could also just think punctuality is respectful? i also do completely log out of my EHR when joining the link and have to log back in and click the next session, which takes a couple minutes, maybe she just has a similar virtual situation? it\u2019s always worth bringing up in session!",
    "The cheapest and easiest method would be to cover the wall to the hallway with sound proof panels like these https://www.amazon.com/Acoustic-Soundproofing-Cancelling-Insulation-Absorbing/dp/B08562K79L/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=sound+proof&qid=1619370122&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExWjlMMkxSVEMxRUpXJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTYyMzUzMlNCMFFUOTdOM1dNSyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTYyMTEwM1ZHNlpWVDdaSVlTQyZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX3Bob25lX3NlYXJjaF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl",

    "[deleted]",
    "Literally me. I could never keep diaries or journals. But I devised a way to get it done and it\u2019s way easier and integrate my love for art. I got a small pocket notebook and lined the pages. Each section has 5 lines to write on. So in my notebook there would be 3 sections on one page. That equals 3 days. Each day I\u2019d limit myself to those 5 lines. That makes it way less daunting and it\u2019s doable as I could finish it in a minute or so. Then when it\u2019s near my appointment, I\u2019d go back and color code. As I reread my entries I\u2019d color each section according to- Green=good. Yellow=could\u2019ve been better. Orange=definitely not good at all.  Red= horrible, worst day. I showed it to my T and he was genuinely impressed and surprised. By doing this I have a simple track of what I go through each day and he could read it if he wants to without it being too much. Color coding also helps me to notice any patterns. I finished my first book last week. Lasted from Dec 17th to Jun 3rd. I could dm you pics for example if you\u2019d like.",
    "Can someone please give OP an award. This is \ud83d\udcaf",
    "I always tell my clients that this is still expression. It still counts, it still helps get out some emotion, etc. You writing FUCK got you into the habit of confiding in your notebook, marked your current mental state to look back on later, and gave you a cool conversation starter. Honestly? I\u2019d still say this is fantastic",

I am sitting in a chair. My ass is in the chair. I wish I could sleep. I cannot sleep. I keep thinking about how I got fired. I made mistakes. The worst mistake was lying about the mistakes. I tell lies because I\u2019m embarrassed. I\u2019m ashamed, and I just wish things never happened, so I pretend they didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d \n\nI use less painful versions when writing letters to friends. \u201cI am starting my second cup of coffee in the hopes that it kick-starts my brain.\u201d",

    "That's such a good point. Thank you! :)",
    "I love that. It kinda siphons off whatever is sitting at the top of your brain so you can dig deeper.",
    "I do that too when journaling! Instead of searching for the perfect first sentence and ending up writing nothing because I'm bored, I write how tired I am, or how angry against my parents, or how scared about school. 90% of the time, I end up writing 6 pages on how life is going.",
    "But which part was talking? What does this part look like? \n\nI\u2019m no artist but sometimes I doodle pictures of my parts. For example, my fixer part is a funny looking big belly construction worker with a hard hat and large mustache.",

    "It's definitely the petulant teenager who is pissed she has to reparent herself, haha.\n\nI've gotten into interacting with my parts via painting. I have synesthesia, and as a result, people have colors to me. And when I interact with a part I can see their color, which is totally weird because I can only see colors for people I've met in person and interacted with.\n\nBut I love love the construction worker part, that's awesome haha.",
    "Say more about synesthesia! I\u2019m curious!",
    "Sounds like you know that part well enough to know what it wants when it comes out. Cell state that fact when you can! I must look like a crazy person at times because I\u2019ll angrily mutter to myself, \u201cwhat do you want!\u201d I get so frustrated at times because I see the parts. They come up to let me know something but I\u2019m often out of tune with what they actually want to say. \n\n\nI\u2019m curious if synesthesia like you have is the historical basis for the concept of seeing auras around people?",
    "It's such a broad term for a bunch of different things where sensory wires are crossed. And these are going to totally sound nuts.\n\nI think there are over 80 recognized types of synesthesia. Some people see colors for different letters and numbers (grapheme-color synesthesia), some people associate tastes with words(lexical\u2013gustatory synesthesia), and there's a ton of others.\n\nI have a couple types:\n\n1. People have colors to me. Synesthesia can either projective (see the color when you look at someone) or associative (look at someone and see their color in your mind's eye). Mine is associative. So everyone I know has a color. Inexplicably, some people have two colors and I've yet to figure out why. My therapist is a lighter sage green but sometimes she's a butter yellow. My best friend is plum. My husband is a tangerine orange, my youngest son is a primary blue, my oldest is lemon yellow, my mother is slate gray, etc etc.\n\n2. I have spatial sequence synesthesia, which means I see numbers and whatnot in a 3D space. When I think about the months, I see them in a circle like a clock. When I think about a year, I see it on a timeline where the older years go to the left backwards and the more recent years are to the right. Basically abstract ideas I can \"see\" in time/space.\n\n3. I have chromesthesia, which is where sounds have colors/shapes. Music when I close my eyes, elicits a kaleidoscope of colors and geometric shapes (and I swear I'm not stoned, haha).\n\n4. Pain-color synesthesia - pain has a color for me... like when I broke my pinky toe on the corner of a door, that pain was bright light blue. When I sliced my finger open on a mandolin, that was bright yellow.\n\n5. Ordinal linguistic personification - basically some letters/numbers/words have colors or feelings or associations. For example, to me, gray and grey are different colors. Some objects to me are either even or odd. There are other quirks to this too.\n\nSo yeah, the tl;dr is that it's totally nuts. I haven't told my therapist about my synesthesia yet haha.",
    "It's good that you're able to be present enough to know when they are showing up. I've only been doing this for a couple months, and I still get wrapped up in being blended with them.\n\nAnd I think you're right about the auras! That particular type of synesthesia can either be projective (so you actually see it) or associative (you look at someone and see the color in your mind's eye). Mine is associative. But the projective type is definitely like the auras!",
    "Very cool! This feels spiritual to me \u2014 more 4D/5D than the standard 3D plane most exist on. Thank you for sharing.",
    "You're welcome! It's pretty cool, but I don't talk about it a ton because it's kinda out there, even though it's just neurobiology essentially.  But I agree, it feels super spiritual to me too. It helps me trust my gut and be very intuitive. Sometimes things just have a \"vibe\".",
    "I am in mandated quarantine until Christmas day. I am having a hard time. My daughter is 4 and misses preschool and it is hard to work while she is around.\n\nAlso my trauma therapist is leaving the agency and she told me with no notice last week. Fortunately I still have my main therapist (the one who I based the therapist in my comics on) and will continue that work with him. But it is still a loss.\n\nSo my mental health is poor right now, but on the upside I made so many comics over the last week. It is my coping mechanism for stress and the ideas have been flying.",

My therapist asked me 3 times if covid perhaps was a reason for my anxiety and I was like \"well, maybe it has made me more socially anxious but otherwise it never once made me feel bad in the way others have. I never left the house before, quarantine is my natural lifestyle\"",
    "That is so much to deal with at once! Sorry to hear about your trauma T leaving. It is certainly hard to say good bye. Please remember to rest and find time to reflect on the work you have done together and grieve the end. It's okay to mourn.\n\nIt's great that you can find a reprieve in your art! I love these comics. You are very creative and talented. Hopefully expressing yourself this way would be able to help you get through the mandated quarantine.

While the processing of life events and the significance of them your day-to-day is very important, I believe that THIS is how therapy can be SO powerful!!! You took a huge risk in articulating this to your therapist. It speaks volumes about your relationship with her, and also about your (growing) strength. I think of the therapy room as kind of a relationship laboratory. It\u2019s a safe place where you can take risks, try out different ideas or ways of being, see what comes up, and eventually bring these new things into your other relationships. I imagine that being so brave and so vulnerable and having such a wonderful reaction from your therapist will help you take similar risks/look out for yourself in your other relationships. And THAT is a huge factor in building a life you love. So happy for you.",
    "A few months back the guy I see never turned up. I sat outside for an hour crying and trying to call him. I sent a few emails and decided to go for a walk. I've had issues with my own confidence and how people view me so this totally fucked my head up. \n\nI got some food and went to sit by the water and felt so sick I couldn't eat. I decided to call a friend to bring me home bc I needed somebody to talk to but just before that I took another walk by his office and the lights were on.\n\nI panicked but knocked immediately and I lost it if I'm being honest. I was in tears asking where he was earlier and he apologised telling me I can come in now and he genuinely made a mistake with the time. We sat down and I got more upset and angry and I ended up storming out.\n\nAfter ten minutes or so I had spoken to somebody on the phone who asked me to go back and at least do this one last session. I went back and we spoke about it and everything else and I realised my own personal issues of people not treating me too well came out to play and I took it immediately really personal when in reality the guy made a mistake. I apologised for how I was and he kept reassuring me that I don't need to and I've been seeing him for months since. \n\nEverybody is only human and make mistakes and I guess when we look at who we go to for help and they make a mistake it can feel so defeating. \n\nYou done really well and I'm proud of you.",
    "I'm so proud of you!!! This is huge!",
    "Wow, as a therapist myself, reading this gave me chills. Your vulnerability was so powerful. Thank you for sharing here!",
    "Good for you! ! I'm proud of you for telling her how you felt. Reading your story made me feel anxious and I'm not sure if I would have had the courage to do what you did.",
    "That's amazing. The last time my T was late, I basically clammed up and refused to look at him or talk to him until he unpacked it all for me. I strive to be as communicative as you were the next time it happens to me.",
    "As someone who has a hard time expressing feelings that may cause confrontation, I\u2019m so impressed and inspired. Thanks for sharing your vulnerability!",
    "wow, you did great. way to advocate for yourself. not only that but allowing yourself to put up a boundary you never thought you could! \n\nHIGH FIVES!",
    "wow thanks for sharing. good for you! I'm proud of you too :)",
    "I am glad you expressed it. \n\nI have been the reason the therapist is late before. I was the suicidal patient. but he couldn't tell you that. He needed a few minutes to breathe before moving on to you so he could best serve you.",
    "Way. To. GO!!!! Love hearing stories like this. \n\nI double-dog dare ya to show this much courage, strength, and vulnerability to the next person in your personal life that does something that upsets you. :P Tell them how you feel. Let them know you feel hurt, angry, frustrated, etc. \n\nNo guarantees the next person will be as gracious, but expressing uncomfortable feelings and not making ourselves feel small and irrelevant can be very empowering!",
    "I love this. You are my hero today.",

    "Damn, the courage that took is unbelievable. Good for you and thank you for sharing. Its helped me see the times I chose to back away from really addressing how I felt rather than being forward. It's not about me, of course, but just wanted to share that you've had a really positive effect.",

    "OP major kudos to you for being vulnerable and honest with your T, asking for what you need, and letting her offer/ accepting efforts to help comfort and repair. But also, while as a patient you have every right to expect punctuality, as a therapist (which I am) sometimes you have to choose between giving your client 5-10 extra minutes to touch their emotions, complete their story, soothe and regulate themselves before ending and being \u2018right on time\u2019 but leaving someone mid-thought or in a really raw state\u2026 we try our best and yet I often opt to give my patients a few extra minutes when needed\u2026 so I\u2019d also try to practice compassion toward them and not taking the lateness personally, but of course there are many factors to consider\u2026 anyhow just wanted to offer a perspective from the \u2018other\u2019 side of the table",

Different circumstances but when I found out she was pregnant (she\u2019s spoken to me in between sessions to let me know) i was so angry with her I\u2019d move myself around the table 180\u00b0. When she asked why I done it I told her that I was upset as she was \u2018deserting\u2019 me and I didn\u2019t know whether I wasn\u2019t to cry or not and thought it was the easiest thing to do so If I did start crying I could flip my camera on my iPad so she could stare at a wall.  So proud of you for saying what you did x",

Thank you for your kind words. \ud83d\udc95",

My T hadn\u2019t had a chance to check her schedule and was going from memory that day and she even shared that Monday\u2019s are her most packed days and she only gets a 30 min break between all her clients and genuinely made a mistake with the timing. Luckily she had time for a full session with me. \nAt the end of the day, therapist are human too and we need to have compassion and empathy for them too.",

    "Thank you, I was SO NERVOUS! Sweating like crazy, clammy cold hands, all of it. I almost wanted to leave, but I didn\u2019t wanna waste the time I had already cut out for it so I just followed my heart and my gut and told her what I needed (her to look away) which was extremely hard, and she was so sweet and acknowledged how hard it was for me to have courage and tell her, which was so nice.",
    "Yes! Even as a therapist I think I\u2019d struggle to verbalize this in my own therapy!",
    "Hell yeah!! I believe you can do it. \nI immediately closed my eyes and covered my face when I realized I didn\u2019t want to look at her and I said it to her while fully hiding, she did not judge and then asked if I wanted her to turn away, which helped so much, I was able to uncover my face and cry and tell her how it made me feel, abandoned and forgotten. And she reassured me that I was NOT forgotten and proceeded to tell me what was going on, on her end and she apologized. \n\nBasically what I\u2019m trying to say is trust your gut with what you need to be able to communicate. In my case it was covering my face and hiding to feel safe.  You got this. (:",
    "Thank you. I really wanted to say \u201cbitch what the fuck!! why\u2019d you forget me?\u201d but I knew better and I know she\u2019s human and makes mistakes. thank god she\u2019s so sweet, she also thanked me for telling her. It\u2019s definitely hard work, we can do it though.",

    "In modern America the name for that house is the psych ward. And it's a bullshit house because, in truth, therapy should ***not*** be what defines you. It's, in general, the trait of mental stress.  \n\n\nAnd, rather than accepting that, society shuns you for experiencing mental stress, says \"not my problem\" to the point of defining you as fundamentally \"other\", and then sends you to a very hidden, often unmoderated person being touted as specialist. Which, some do certainly help.  \n\n\nBut the medicalized model of therapy as \"is you\" and not \"what happened to lead to these behaviors being expressed, which may include both nature and nurture aspects\", is a huge critique of modern therapy not talked about nearly enough.  \n\n\nAnd this meme is a great example supporting that barbaric way of handling those in emotional distress. It's not fair to the therapist or the client to frame things solely and only as an individual problem.",
    "I don\u2019t want to speak out against your experiences if you have experiences in this realm. I\u2019d actually like to apologize because you\u2019re right about both the medical model and the prior psych wards. You\u2019re also absolutely right and I agree that therapy isn\u2019t what defines you, your thoughts don\u2019t define you, and your diagnosis doesn\u2019t define you. To me, at least, it\u2019s all about living for/toward your values. Additionally, I would like to at least offer up that there is a newer generation of therapists and flexible older generation of therapists who are more person first and recognize the impact of life experiences on a person and the environmental stressors in their lives. I understand and apologize if I may have accidentally missed part of the purpose of your response.",
    " \"But the medicalized model of therapy as \"is you\" and not \"what happened to lead to these behaviors being expressed, which may include both nature and nurture aspects\", is a huge critique of modern therapy not talked about nearly enough. \"\n\nIt seems my experience with the world of therapy is very different than yours.  People are tripping all over themselves to add \"trauma informed\" to their psychology today profiles.  I feel like the medical model, while still a huge part of psychotherapy, is also somewhat waning.  Insurance anchors it to some extent, but there's a big push to incorporate understanding of trauma into therapy.",
    "Fair enough. Thanks for the compassionate response. Sounds like you've had some good experiences with therapy, and perhaps this post was even meant to celebrate that.\n\nMy experiences with therapy, across six years and over a dozen practitioners, has been more negative than good. And I've come to the point of actively critiquing the practice as a whole. Not every corner of it, and do believe it can and has helped some people in some settings. But not nearly enough is talked about the limitations and failures. And I've found problematic attitudes with therapists of every age range. It's anecdotal of course.\n\nAt any rate, apology accepted!",
    "What does trauma-informed mean to you? It feels like a buzz word term that's starting to lose any actual meaning. Anyone can *say* they are trauma-informed, but that doesn't mean they actually treat trauma effectively. \n\nTrauma can also be placed either within or outside the medical model. So I don't see how \"incorporating trauma\", in and of itself, discourages medical model style practice. But, to clarify, semantics and operational definitions for terms get very tricky with all this. And it seems easy for two people to actually agree on underlying concepts while also using terms differently.",
    "I\u2019d have to agree with you about \u201ctrauma-informed care\u201d as someone who\u2019s worked on the technician level at a couple different psychiatric facilities. Employers, or treatment providers, advertise being trauma-informed yet the sentiment is so quickly lost once that trauma actually manifests itself. There certainly are those in the field who genuinely bear in mind individual traumas but it seems to most often be thrown out the window or completely ignored rather quickly when the prescribed treatment isn\u2019t working as effectively as envisioned. On top of that, many other technician level employees have no idea what that being trauma-informed even means or what it is trying to accomplish. I can\u2019t speak to how therapists or doctors treat the phrase but so many technicians could care less. There is obviously a difference in education for the positions but the impact can be just as detrimental.",

    "It's so cool that you made this list. It's like a therapeutic exercise in itself, being able to identify the ways in which your needs can be met. I think you've inspired me to try to do something similar. There are so many things that my therapist has done for me, that I sadly forget all too often, especially when I feel frustrated with them.",
    "All of the upvotes if I could. I made a similar list when I went to therapy the first time. It helps to keep track of what works for you and what doesn't, and importantly stick to what does work",

    "I know they're really different things but as someone who's just starting work as a resi carer with young people who have experienced significant trauma, this was very helpful. It's not an easy thing to find a good therapist, so shit, I'm also just happy for you. Gl",
    "Therapist checking in. This is beautiful and well written and shows so much safety that I hope I give to my clients, especially those who have experienced trauma.\n\nThank you so so so much for sharing this. All the best to you!",

I am so happy for you that you and your therapist participate in this healthy healing relationship. \n\nI deal with disorganized/avoidant attachment too and am lucky enough to have the same kind of therapist. It has made all the difference. \n\nI love the part about your therapist allowing you to care for them but not take care of them. This goes both ways in my therapy relationship too. It\u2019s somehow what makes the relationship feel most reciprocal - therapist acknowledging that my feelings of care for her are normal human feelings and welcome, not examined or put off as transference. It makes me realize that I am capable of relationships and feeling connected even when I have had very few experiences in the real world like this.",
    "Wow I love this. And I totally agree. My favorite things about my therapist are the details. Whenever I am starting to panic in a session and get overwhelmed, she leans forward and sits at the very edge of her couch, looks and me and softly says the truth. It\u2019s so comforting. She also will notice when I dissociate and softy say \u201chey, come back\u201d. And when I do finally finish freaking out and I calm down and look at her, she smiles and says \u201chey. I\u2019m here\u201d. I love her so much.",

Maybe they can\u2019t meet your need of being on time but maybe they can meet your need of acknowledging when it happens & also accounting for that in the time you pay for. If acknowledging your experience of them doesn\u2019t happen, then it says a lot about them and their capacity to support you.",
    "Therapist here. That's definitely not ok. Please voice you concern with them and if not enough, with their immediate supervisor. Being late is unethical and you deserve for them to be on time.",

It's kind of a ritual :)",

    "He has some variations like \"how is it going\" \"how was your week\", something like this.\nIts mostly at the beginning and often while we sit down and actually helps me to calm down at the beginning.",
    "Thanks :) \n\nYeah it feels weird at the beginning, speaking for myself it gets better with time, but I also still struggle sometimes with being entirely open after almost a year - getting there :) \n\nDuring the first sessions he would more start with \"is there something you wanna talk about\" or \"do you have a topic today?\" but I was totally overwhelmed and overthinking that question. I have the feeling since I addressed that he is using more the \"how are you\" variations to kick off the session and after a short small talk I'm calm enough to go into the deeper stuff. \nHe explained to me that it isn't rude at all if I'm not asking back because it's about me and it's a different question coming from him compared to friends or co-workers. But as you say it's a unique relationship and it takes some time to adjust to it, which is also a good topic to talk about. We actually just recently got into that, so as you see even after almost the double amount of your time I'm still learning about the therapeutic process and relationship itself :) And it's not my first time. So don't be too hard on yourself :) \n\nI hope that was at least a bit helpful since it was just me rambling about my personal experience and having a hard time translating my thoughts :)",

    "It's interesting how different things can be for people!\n\nI myself have anxiety and I suppose I am very sick of being scared all the time. I can suppress sadness or guilt well enough, but fear suppression for some reason always ends up being anger. Attack is the best defense, etc.\n\nIt may also be that I always see fear as the main emotion in this kind of scenario. FEAR of being embarrassed. FEAR of being the guilty party. FEAR of being abandoned (jealousy related). FEAR of being disappointed in myself. \n\nAnd what is anxiety if not for a lot of fear?",
    "Similar thing with me. Instead of anxiety, I just act very evasive and emotionally-distant. I've only just recently been able to get in-touch with my angry emotions and I was startled how much is there - literally a lifetime's worth of anger balled up inside me.\n\nI wasn't able to express anger in childhood either but I accumulated a lot due to a similar inability to express my social anxiety, and a need to 'tough out' my problems. I suppose it's worth asking yourself where your anger is coming from?",
    "Yep, I'm the same.\n\nUsed to think I was the most socially anxious person in the world.\n\nNope, I'm just sick of peoples' shit and have never felt allowed to express that. Now I do, kind of a lot, and boom, anxiety gone.",
    "Was not prepared.",
    "That's new for me. Obviously emotions are not clear cut, but I always thought the most logical chain would be fear -> anger?\n\nI guess for some people fear is like a \"blanket\" smothering anger and when fear gets removed you feel how angry you actually are. Is that how it is for you?",
    "Insecurities. Including anxiety.\n\nUpon further examination it looks like fear is directed towards things that we actually encounter while anxiety is directed towards things that we haven't or even do not actually encounter. Both stem from insecurity though.",
    "It's weird how I recently finished reading \"The gift of Fear\"  by Gavin De Becker. I was worried that I was losing touch with my intuition and running behind logic since I spend way too much time explaining away my worries in a logical manner. Listing pros and cons in my head etc. This book just taught me that I still have my intuition. \n\nAnyway, I mentioned this book to my therapist yesterday and she immediately went on to say \"may be anxiety is a gift too, all emotions are a gift from the universe. They have a purpose to fulfill. And my be they linger on until they're heardand their purpose is fulfilled.\" \n\nAnd I'm trying to process this perspective. Putting it out there for whoever needs to hear this",
    "Wish you well, hopefully one day you can find what makes you feel better the most!",
    "When anger is not acceptable or safe to show, it gets masked away just like other emotions can. My impression is it's actually one of the most frequently masked emotions, because it's usually more outwardly directed/visible than other emotions. \n\n\"Safe\" includes \"safe for the environment\", too. So it's not just a matter of not showing anger to stay safe yourself, but also for example for children who are parentified (put in a place where they are the caretaker for a parent of both of them, or the family) showing anger often is not done because of its negative impact on the other, to-be-protected people. Not as a conscious choice, mind, but as general adjustment to the environment.",
    "The premise for how I experience it is that the reason for was I was angry was not acceptable and reprimanded, hence shame and fear got called in to cover up my anger. It was totally valid looking back, but I was scared of even giving people a hint of how I felt, cause I knew that the shame, bullying and fear was easier to deal with than anger on how I was treated.",
    "I think this one is my favorite!",
    "Heh me. Like no I do not want to talk about my trauma. My T is really good at gently steering me that way though",
    "Okay so I am a therapist, and also go to therapy myself- and I think this is significant growth. Feelings of worthlessness would lead to people not discussing their interests, or thoughts that seem 'irrelevant' to the problem at hand. Or because they think their thoughts and interests are worthless too. Being able to do that over time not only tells me that there is a significant bit of rapport and trust with the therapist, but also that this person is a lot more comfortable being vulnerable, a lot more confident about their worth, and a lot less guarded!",
    "This reminded me when i did a tour of my room through videocall to my therapist lol",
    "I love this -- me 100%. I think, weirdly enough, that talking about that kind of random shit requires a lot of trust that I can't just give to people immediately. Not everyone will put up with my tangents and info dumping so it's truly a great honor. (Even though yes, I am probably also avoiding something scary.)",
    "HAHAHAHA! Are you me?!  Omg I'm dying laughing over here!",
    "I really love your comics! This is so relatable! During the first session I was rambling for like at least 15 minutes and talked about some very hurtful and deep stuff ( and yes we still had to fill out the intake form \ud83d\ude05) and now 1 year later some sessions are just me trying to avoid to talk about trauma and bringing up some random stuff like TV shows instead.",

I've much improved, though I still lie a bit. I remind myself that I don't want her to *like* me, but to *heal* me, and it's just like lying to my doctor about my health.",
    "It's a challenge because my therapist is helping me to both trust my gut more while *also* recognising that my interpretation of reality is subjective and can be changed. So I need to believe my own impressions, but also not take them at face value? It makes sense now, but it took a while for me to wrap my head around.",
    "Glad I'm not alone in this. It really shows how much of what we feel depends on interpretation. My first thought about this was actually \"why would you think your therapist cares this much, you're just another patient.\" As if patients aren't important?

I\u2019ve made 28 of these. \n\nIn all seriousness, the structure and method of therapy is really fascinating to me, it\u2019s simultaneously the most boundaried/professional and most personal relationship I have - there isn\u2019t really anything like it and so things happen in therapy that don\u2019t happen anywhere else. It\u2019s a delicate art too. So I think about those things after session and a comic strip condenses those thoughts down to a few squares.",

    "That\u2019s interesting. I am probably just projecting because I\u2019m working on taking things people say at face value and not being skeptical or suspicious about their true feelings/intentions. \nI envy your therapy experience. Mine has been underwhelming. Group therapy on the other hand is extremely helpful and invigorating though.",
    "In my experience, its 1-2-1. But is different in different settings. The person doesn\u2019t know the client/patient. The info that is shared is only in so far as to contextualise what needs to be talked about. So if i was worried about a safety thing and whether to intervene; that gets discussed. But broadly speaking its focussed on clinical techniques and how the clinician is responding. Its not a rehash of the sessions. \n\nWorking privately there is still supervision. At least in UK. You just pay for it rather than being in house. Its a requirement for ethical body membership",

    "It needs to say at the end \"but I'm going to keep coming back and giving you my money because I at least have someone to has to listen to me that I don't feel as guilty for talking about my problems to constantly.\"",
    "Totally feeling this. At some point I was getting stressed out before sessions because I had to come up with something to talk about. \n\nTherapy didn't really help me...it's weird. Most tips they gave me I heard already from 1000 self help youtube videos and ted talks. Before therapy I always dreamed about how I'd go there and finally all the problems I had would dissolve but instead it was just another thing that didn't help me :(",

    "Lol",
    "Hi, i understand completely why you feel so. If I may, I'll just say one thing. The \"therapist\" wasn't able to help you but not \"therapy\" in general. One therapist doesn't mean therapy in totality will never work out for you, that one therapist didn't work out for you! Please keep looking for that one therapist that will get you and will help you get through this. I assure you they exist.\n\n\nI too am a therapist who also has mental health problems. I too go to my own therapist and yes it takes a while to meet that one therapist who will help you succeed, but you will. \ud83c\udf3b",
    "first of all thank you for the warm words and you're right I didn't mean to say therapy in general, just the two therapists I saw. In that regard I do continue my own therapy of being mindful, meditating and working out which helps so much already.\n\nIt's so hard looking for the right therapist tho because you have to make an appointment first, wait 1-2 months and even then it's only after 2-3 session one can make a decision if this is the right one, this whole process is tiring so I'll wait till I search for another one.",
    "I totally understand that. Therapy has become quite the luxury and the time period between you wanting a session and you actually having a session, is rather a long time and usually you can be in two completely different states then. So I get that. It can indeed be taxing. \n\nTry to find a therapist who can understand this concern of yours. I'm sure they will atleast try to accomodate you. Or you could always make appointments beforehand for the whole month. That has worked quite well for me. :)",
    "My therapist: \u201cAnd how does that make you feel?\u201d\n\n*Me, after 5 minutes of pondering in silence*: \u201c.....bad\u201d.",

    "It is important that they have training in this, but it could also be problematic if before youve had the chance to sit down and say how it affects you, they are speaking about race in general terms like this. Although there is lots of shared trauma, everyone experiences racism slightly differently and I'd say it's important to tell your therapist how it is for you. Perhaps ask them what training or experience they've had on working with race.",
    "As a therapist, I think it\u2019s my job to address this from the beginning. When I have a new client come in with different skin color, I want to address that ASAP. I want to talk about that difference and how I plan to work with them, what my own history is, and I want to know if they are comfortable with that, because if not, I want to help them find someone they are comfortable with. I think that\u2019s my job. \n\nDo other therapists not do this?",

    "As a white (I hate this term)  therapist (psychologist and psychoanalyst) working in South Africa I'd like to say that while it is, of course, possible to work well across race, there is also something to be said for finding a black therapist.   \n\n\nIn SA, identifying with the term \"Black\" vs \"POC\" is seen as taking a stand and a step towards black consciousness (a good thing). \n\nI do work with many black clients and it often goes well. However, there are additional layers of complexity when the perpetrator and oppressed work together. Managing these and using them in therapeutically constructive ways while keeping one's own defensiveness in check (the therapists) is no easy task and can often derail things even with the best intentions. There can be something inherently painful about being faced with a \"White\" therapist, evidence of structural inequality, racism, privilege, and a host of other things. It can even foster feelings of inferiority and a sense of being looked down on (which may or may not be happening).   \nYes, there is also greater scope for healing and reconciliation over the longer term but the work is advanced and to easily carried out without a high level of maturity and self-awareness on the part of the therapist. Few training institutions that I know of prepare clinicians for this an instead train them to work with diagnoses. \n\nThe minefields are many. For example, I might mention something that Steve Biko (black consciousness leader of which I am a fan) wrote. And this is then experienced as a microaggression where the client experiences me forcing them into a version of blackness constructed through my whiteness, i.e. that they should also be a fan of Biko.  The client may never raise this, and the damage remains unaddressed, and if they do they are often met with defensive reactions, e.g. \"that's not what I meant\" or \"I'm not racist you know\" instead of \"Oh I see what I did. I'm sorry. I'd like to hear more.\" Or, \"the racist shop attendant ignored me\" and the therapists say \"That happens to me too\". Or, \n\nWe need much much more work in this area. It brings to mind an article that I was sent. Hopefully, someone finds it helpful.

The idea that asking a therapist an incredibly complicated question before you've had any time to get to know each other in order to determine their competence is ludicrous!  \n\nAnd what makes it worse is the idea that there is a singular psychological impact.  The only competent answer is \"it depends.\"",
    "I haven't heard about this being done a lot but I'm curious, maybe try asking r/Psychotherapy\n\n\nAlso sometimes this can come across a bit weird, like I (a PoC) remember getting a cab once and this white dude immediately started talking to me about trump this, trump that.\n\n\nI mean maybe it was just an attempt to make a convo, or he's just super politically active, or he was just empathizing or trying to gain woke-brownie points? Idek man I just wanted a ride lmao, but at the time I kinda took it differently. (He was fortunately against 45 so it could've been worse.)\n\n\nIt feels like **my existence is inherently political.** I can't explain how many times I'm just in a room with all white ppl and then somehow politics get started and of course ppl start looking at me like a fucking zoo animal and it's awkward & unpleasant.\n\n\nLike when I walk down the street, I don't feel as if people are looking at me as a human being, I feel as if they're looking at me through a political lens? \n\nI'm not sure if I'm explaining this right sorry, but yeah it's like my skin immediately ignites the political train of thought in people's mind.\n\n\nThis could just be my social anxiety speaking as well so take it with a grain of salt. \n\n\nWhat's even more silly is when people lable human rights as \"politics\", as if it's debatable lmao\n\n\nBut I appreciate you being self-informed and educated on how important it is to create a secure space for your patients!\n\n\nSometimes it's just a doomed if u do, doomed if u don't type of situation, but that doesn't mean it's ur fault obviously.\n\n\n\n**I reccomend you just put up a little book, symbol, of some sorts representing your views. For example, a pride flag.**\n\n\nMy first T had a calendar with a pic of a WoC in a protest against a line of police. At that point I didn't even knew anything about her but it gave me an idea that she's not stupid.\n\n\n\nJust a warning though: this can definitely backfire on some bigoted patients or if they're schizophrenic and think the government is out to get them",
    "I\u2019m also a therapist and do the same thing! It\u2019s definitely our role to make sure we are able to provide the care that individuals are looking for. I work in community mental health so referrals are limited but I do my best to make sure my clients know that should they want/need a therapist that looks like them or reflects them, that\u2019s always a viable option.",
    "I know you only have good intentions and are trying to be empathetic but I'd be cautious about having this approach. You may just end up alienating your clients. Some people may appreciate it but others just want to be treated like regular people and not have their therapist immediately emphasizing their differences and otherizing them. If I had a therapist immediately launch into a tirade about my ethnicity then I'd feel quite uncomfortable and I probably wouldn't come back. If I want to discuss racism and my ethnicity then I'd bring it up myself. If your client is from an ethnic minority group (or any other minority group) then they are probably already very aware about your differences and don't need them reinforced. My current therapist is an old white Christian guy and I appreciate that he just treats me like he would anyone else whilst still being open-minded and non-judgemental about our cultural differences. I've had younger white therapists who feel the need to go on and on about my minority status and tell me how I'm oppressed by society and, honestly, it's quite infantilizing and just comes across as virtue-signalling and them projecting their sense of white guilt onto me. It also ironically has the reverse effect of discouraging me from speaking with them about experiences of racism and discrimination as I don't want to encourage their behavior or make them feel bad about themselves. That's just my two cents though.\n\nEdit: Obviously, that's not to say I think you should dance around the subject of ethnicity either. Just that you should leave it up to the individual to decide how much they want to discuss it. Just asking a simple \"where are you from?\", \"what's your cultural background?\", or a casual \"I like your name, what language is it?\" is great way to approach it imo as then that gives the individual the opportunity to discuss the matter in depth if they like or to just answer matter-of-factly and move on to discussing the problems that they're there to see you for.",
    "I am a person of color and would honestly feel a bit alienated by this. \n\nIt says that one of the first things you notice is the color of my skin.",
    "No, I don\u2019t do this. I did this for a short time early in my career but the POC looked at me like I was from mars. It was an awkward empathic failure. Being sensitive to possible issues that could arise in therapy because of different cultural backgrounds/class/gender, etc.of course is of value. But to overtly bring it up with a client because it is your, the therapist\u2019s, concern is not good therapy. Well intentioned, but still bad therapy.",
    "Curious if you do the same thing with sexual orientation and disability?",
    "I don't but I'm \"just\" a psychologist. I just don't think it matters. If race comes up in conversation or the client's issues have something to do with it, yes then we will talk about it. \n\nThen again, I don't live in USA so maybe it is different here.",
    "I can imagine all the.... ' my therapist decided not to work with me because I was black' posts that would result. You can work with the issue of difference in any context, and to highlight skin colour as soon as the client enters the room seems some what judgemental and unempathetic to me. The opposite to what we ars supposed to provide. \n\nBut that may be just me.",
    "I agree, but also I don't think POC should just seek out POC as therapists. \n\nIt would depend on the kind of therapy you're after. Personally I've had an excellent therapist who is a white woman but she's compassionate as hell, and also understands racial/ cultural issues because of her own life experience. But also I haven't seeked therapy related to my own cultural issues. It's been entirely about me, and that's kinda how I want it",
    "Second this :) I\u2019m both a social worker (not doing therapy, but case man) and a person of colour. Bringing up race and culture without being prompted is a little...rude, almost. If people don\u2019t allude to it, don\u2019t ask. Sometimes we just want to be treated like regular old people with regular old problems. That being said, I usually ask where people are from (like what city/how long you been here etc. Some people answer it with their ethnic background too)- and that\u2019s often enough to get a grasp on whether they are cultural/tied to their community or not. \n\nAlso just want to say that there are many Ts who think they are culturally safe but therapy with them is disastrous. I\u2019ve had a number of therapists not from my background who have all said \u201coh yea totally i\u2019m 100% culturally and spiritually safe to talk to\u201d and then they go and do damage by pushing against my beliefs. So....we\u2019ve got work to do, for sure. Would love to see more diversity in the field\n\nLastly - to actually address the photo in question. Hell yea, interview your therapists to make sure they will work for you. Ask them anything and everything including political issues if needed. That is trauma too.",
    "Is that just what men in cabs do? I got in a cab and the driver couldn't figure out if i was a man or woman (I'm a woman with really short hair/dress gender neutral). He spent the first half of the ride not saying anything and then asked me my name. After that (since he figured out I was female) everything related to gay stuff going on in the area/questions about my sexuality.",
    "I feel this often, especially now. I\u2019ve had a few white people randomly message me checking in on me and giving me a laundry list of all the things they\u2019ve done to support the Black Lives Matter movement. They also ask me what else they should do to help. It\u2019s well intended but I don\u2019t really want to have to think about the movement 24/7, and I don\u2019t want to have to feel pressured to validate their deeds and opinions.",
    "I\u2019m tired and I goofed and replied to the wrong person. \n\nYou are right, you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel like your existence is political and I apologize for that. I have several LGBTQ+ clients so I do have a few books in my office like The Red Crayon to help clients coming in for the first time to feel more comfortable. \n\nI work at educating myself continually. I know I\u2019m not perfect, but I focus on forging that therapeutic relationship with my clients so they feel comfortable with me and I encourage them to tell me when I make a mistake so I can fix it and learn from it. There\u2019s always going to be differences between me and my clients, as we will never have the same background or experiences, so I want to talk about that and explore it. Maybe not all therapists do, but I was actually taught that in school. \n\nI also understand how difficult it is to go to therapy, as I attend my own counseling sessions, too, I know how it feels from both sides of the couch. It\u2019s not always easy talking about your feelings.",
    "Yes, exactly! Our community is small and not very diverse, so I feel I have to address those issues immediately for my clients. It is their decision whether or not to move forward, but I want them to know I\u2019m not afraid to address it and work on it ongoing with them.",
    "I hear you. I don\u2019t think I launch into a tirade. I generally approach it more like \u201care you comfortable working with me as a white woman?\u201d If they say yes, then great, I drop it and move on. If not, I give them referrals. If they ask me questions about my background, approach, theory, etc, yay! I welcome that and we have that discussion.",
    "I think it's definitely worth putting on the table because some clients need \"permission\" to discuss certain topics, but I agree that there's a tendency for certain types of therapists to try to push the issue.",
    "Yes. I encourage talk about differences. I prefer for clients to interview me and ask me questions, as well. I do display books in my office that are about gender equality (from The Red Crayon to Dara Hoffman-Fox\u2019s workbook) and I also encourage my clients to tell me if I make a mistake.  I am human and am not perfect, but I am willing to correct myself and learn. I do also try to read/educate myself. I recognize I am not going to be the right therapist for everyone, and that\u2019s ok. There are some clients who I know I cannot work with, and that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m fine with giving them referrals out. \n\nWhat I do know is that today\u2019s world isn\u2019t easy. It feels like we are being hit by one thing after another, and the anxiety and fears from the beginning of the year have turned into overwhelming anguish and outrage. I am absolutely anti-racist and not afraid to talk about it because I see it as part of my role as not just a social worker, but as a white person. I get that for racism to stop, I have to make sure I\u2019m calling out others on it.  I am simply trying to help one person at a time. That may not be good enough for some people, but it is what I can do.",
    "I have had two male therapists do this due to me being a victim of domestic violence and them being concerned that if we were going to be doing trauma work I might get triggered by them being males. Sadly, neither of those relationships worked out but not because they were males.",
    "You're right, I guess I was thinking more about how there aren't enough POC educators and role models for all the POC kids.",
    "I as a poc don't feel that havin compassion bcuz u have witnessed it equals the same level of compassion for having personally experienced it. I need someone that understands war bcuz they too have been in it, not just seen the affects of it. This may just be me personally. Regardless, I'm thankful I even have the option for mental health help and have options to choose from.",
    "Just a little advice: ANY therapist who says they're 100% competent or safe in ANY area is a charlatan",
    "What beliefs have they pushed against?",
    "I think that's perfectly fine then and I would imagine that your clients probably appreciate your openness. I've just had bad experiences with tone-deaf therapists (not saying you're one, of course!) making a bigger deal out of it then necessary. I don't hold it against them though as I understand they're just trying to be empathetic and they're probably not aware of it as any clients who have felt uncomfortable by it have probably felt it would be too awkward to tell them.",
    "I\u2019m also a therapist, and I don\u2019t address visible differences or cultural differences as they come to light unless initiated by the client. I thought a lot about this concept, and I think it depends on how clients come into your care. I\u2019m in private practice, so my clients elect to work with me. I also work in a metropolitan area, so there is a lot of access to therapists. Since they\u2019ve initiated our work together, I assume they\u2019re ok with how I look and our potential differences. If they were being assigned instead, I\u2019d probably take a different approach.",
    "[deleted]",
    "I\u2019ve had clients apologize/ask permission to explore different things in their own lives for fear of offending me (usually based on their cultural expectations of what\u2019s acceptable to discuss with a woman or non-family member). It is of great value to find a way to express to clients that there\u2019s no topic that is off limits to discuss, but it\u2019s not our job to assume what may/may not be comfortable or worth discussing for the client.",
    "Yeah, valid. We should have equal rates of POC and white therapists, and that should be the goal of society.",
    "Haha! True. Well, i may have also exaggerated a bit there...they said \u201ci\u2019m open to any and all experiences, i\u2019m here to support you etc etc.\u201d I interviewed them about their biases and they said  \u201ci\u2019m open to learning, i\u2019ve got my own practices and ways of seeing the world, but if it\u2019s a part of your life then that\u2019s important.\u201d They said all the right things...but unconscious bias still slipped through.",
    "1. Some of them kept reiterating boundaries. We are collectivist...boundaries are important but boundaries work different in our community, especially with family. I\u2019ve worked in Indig communities where i\u2019m from, had the exact same feedback from them.\n2. Spirituality is super important to me. I would say as a culture, we are fairly steeped in it and it impacts our worldview whether we want it to or not. Had a T tell me our scriptures are \u201cjust a book written by some random person.\u201d Nah that aint it. So disrespectful. I screened her thoroughly before choosing her as my T too, and she said she was fully open to spirituality etc, but obviously her biases leaked thru in a very minimizing way. \n3. Overly clinical pathological approach to care. I was explaining a phenomenon that occurs within my culture, T says \u201ci think you may have bipolar.\u201d Pissed me right off because members of my community can completely identify with this phenomenon ....it\u2019s very common....and had she listened, she would realize that. It felt very diminishing of my reality. \n\nJust a few things that I can think of off the top of my head. Thanks for asking :) that being said...i also have had good therapists who are authentic and genuine about the things they dont know and the mistakes they might make. I have completely loved them :) it really just depends on the person",
    "Thank you. The comments here certainly are making me think...\u201dam I addressing this properly? Am I meeting my client\u2019s needs?\u201d I know I\u2019m not perfect by any means, but I do promise to keep challenging and educating myself to be better.",
    "Point taken. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.",
    "Hopefully, this explanation helps: When working with clients who are not white, I will typically address it during intake by pointing out the fact that I am a white woman (\\~if you hadn't noticed), but if they ever feel I've misunderstood something due to those differences in lived experiences, I want them to feel safe addressing it with me. It breaks the tension a bit (if there is any) and opens up that conversation.\n\nI've been largely educated by Black people and grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood, so I feel no discomfort. But I want my clients to feel understood, and know they can comfortably have that conversation with me if at some point they do not.",
    "The thing is that POC are a minority, thats why we don't have equal amounts. \n\nIts probably not really possible to have what you are saying unless you want to force some POC to become therapists",
    "Thank you for this! And I'm glad you have found good therapists too. \n\nThis made me look at my work from a different angle. I like to think of myself as being open to any and all cultures whether I agree with them or not, but I struggle with those cultural issues that clearly are not good for the person's well-being. Most extreme example of this is the gypsy (not exactly the right word but as close as possible) in Finland, in which families have massive wars with eachother which leads to violence and even deaths. I have heard some of them say that they would just like to change to normal \"white people\" clothes and move but their culture is holding them back. \n\nSorry for the long comment, I got a bit carried away here oops",
    "So long as you have that attitude then I think you're doing great. Remaining open to the possibility that there might be things you could be doing better or ways of approaching things that might be more effective is the key imo. So long as you're making an effort to be open-minded and to understand other's experiences and address their needs then I don't think you have anything to worry about. That's all anyone can really ask for.",
    "Okay, it doesn\u2019t have to be similar numbers, but rather it could be similar proportions of the population, like however many white therapist divided by the white population and POC therapist divided by POC population?",
    "But even if something seems on the surface like it\u2019s not good for a person\u2019s well-being, that doesn\u2019t mean that in the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s actually that bad. It depends on the client and what they want too. If they think it\u2019s unhealthy, then it is. But for example: my sis was stressed out cus she had post-partum & her mother in law was coming down to visit. MIL and husband did not ask whether MIL can come and stay for a few weeks. Sis mentioned this to a T who was like \u201cwow they didn\u2019t even ask you?!\u201d And my sis was like...\u201dno....she\u2019s family...she doesn\u2019t need to ask. That\u2019s not how it works for us.\u201d Which is true. And it blocked my sister from venting and getting out how stressful it was because it kept coming back to boundaries. She came home and was like \u201cshe\u2019s coming whether i like it or not - i\u2019m not telling her that she can\u2019t!\u201d Thus she didnt go back to this particular T. I don\u2019t know any MILs who ask permission to come over in our community... it\u2019s seen as very rude to deny family. But when MIL comes over, she\u2019s also cleaning and taking care of the kids which is helpful, in the bigger picture\n\nRe: gypsy culture. Once again it comes back down to what the person wants. If a person says they want to leave, then yes, it might be time to talk about boundaries and supporting them to integrate more into western society. Even if those families are violent and chaotic, if someone doesn\u2019t want to leave you can\u2019t make them. That culture sounds similar to street culture....there\u2019s so much violence and dysfunction in the homeless pop but i\u2019m there to just listen and see what intervention points are going to be accepted by said individual.\n\nSorry that was a super long response. Apologies :)",
    "How do you know thats not the case already?",
    "You do have good points! Culture is a tricky thing to deal with since I \"don't have any\" meaning that I am part of the majority. What also influences my thinking is that I used to work in a prison so my views may be skewed in a certain direction... \n\nThank you for giving me stuff to think about!",
    "\u201cIn 2015, 86 percent of psychologists in the U.S. workforce were white, 5 percent were Asian, 5 percent were Hispanic, 4 percent were black/African-American and 1 percent were multiracial or from other racial/ethnic groups.1 This is less diverse than the U.S. population as a whole, which is 62 percent white and 38 percent racial/ethnic minority.\u201d\n\n\nhttps://www.apa.org/monitor/2018/02/datapoint\n\nI also don\u2019t think that the rates of that would have improved significantly enough in the past 5 years, since economic mobility and access to education, health care, and knowledge of people\u2019s rights are not functioning well enough for POC in America.",
    "But you do have culture! Even if you are part of the majority - you have roots in europe, and maybe that\u2019s something you can explore a little bit more. \nYeah, well there you go. It would have been important for you to identify unhealthy behaviours & address them in your prison job, especially keeping in mind individuals would be released back into community. So i get that. But yea i would just reflect on where we get our ideas of healthy/unhealthy behaviour & how that\u2019s been influenced by our own culture. We all got unconscious biases which is ok!\n\nAnyways thanks for being open to listening. Hope you have a lovely rest of your day :)",
    "Fair enough, though I still don't see how to get those numbe s higher. \n\nI think it would have to be indirect (i.e getting equal education and opportunities)",

It was like she let me leave the hospital with blood pouring out...\n\nNote to add: current therapist is phenomenal at keeping time, giving me a few extra minutes if necessary, helping me \u201ctuck in\u201d the pain safely, and will often check in with me later...\n\nEdit: last sentence; wording",
    "I don\u2019t even know where my therapist keeps the clock in her office but she always paces things 100% perfectly. She\u2019s a sorcerer",
    "Therapist in training and I can attest, I look at the clock so I don\u2019t open up a huge can of worms that makes my client really upset and dissociated to the point of not paying attention to traffic when they walk out the door. Timing is everything. I always try to wrap things up in session by giving them a heads up and helping them calm down if we went through some difficult material.",
    "Also, I make sure patients can see a clock to help them use their time as they think best. I\u2019ve found that when they bring up something important at the end of a session and they know the time, it\u2019s often because they want help from me in talking about it at their next session.",
    "This is absolutely the truth. I\u2019m pacing the session, not wishing it was over. \ud83d\udcaf",
    "Yep. My does this exactly. You can see she wants to say something. Then she looks at the clock to see where we are at and will stop herself, or say remind me to talk about xyz next week. And the next week we pick up where we left off",
    "Really needed this. I got upset the other day when I saw my T looking at the time. After I left the office I realized that I was being stupid. It was a busy day and he had one more client. I felt selfish for thinking that way, I wished that I had more time. I feel so bad but I understand now. There will be other sessions. Even though sometimes you might have a lot to talk about there might not be enough time to bring it up. As I have this little pattern figured out when it comes to our discussions next time I\u2019ll think a bit more before I bring up something heavy that might take time to talk about!",
    "When I was in a dual diagnostic center a couple years ago, there was this intern/therapist in training. And one assignment my therapist gave me was to write a timeline of my life (it\u2019s helpful when trying to process trauma). \n\nMy therapist was out that day so I went to her intern and she decided to go over it with me. She told me AT THE END OF THE SESSION that I should tell my parents about the person who raped me! It opened a door and the rest of the week I was a crying mess. I ended up switching therapists and talking to another lady who has a similar life story that gave me better advice\u2665\ufe0f",
    "Also, as a therapist, I put a clock where my clients can see it as I want you to know how much time we have left so you don\u2019t bring up a huge issue when there are only minutes left....it\u2019s better if it\u2019s earlier and we have time to work thru it (at least enough for you to calm down enough to go home safely)",
    "Haha as a patient I\u2019ve done this for the exact same reasons",
    "Wow, thank you for sharing that, I had no idea.",
    "Thank you!",
    "i keep an eye on the time in my sessions lol i just hate running late, even when my T allowed sessions to run over occassionally it would make me so anxious lol",
    "Typically it\u2019s behind you somewhere. One of mine kept one on the end table off to the side and back a little, generally obscured by throw pillows. My current therapist has one hanging on the wall over the couch. I assume she just uses her computer clock now. \n\nBut to your point, mine doesn\u2019t seem to look up at the clock that often (I\u2019ve seen a few posts over on r/psychotherapy saying that they keep them behind where we sit so we won\u2019t notice them looking at it \u2014 haha most of us can see when your eyes shift somewhere up or to the side). She\u2019s got this timing thing down pretty good. I try to be aware also.",
    "I give pretty clocks to new therapists as gifts. I was given one as a new psychologist, and it's become a tradition. I treasure that clock!",
    "Also, it's rare to maintain steady eye contact (it would be really intense if someone stared deep into your eyes with every single word), so it's pretty easy to casually glance over at the clock for .002 seconds and have it look natural or not noticed at all. I keep 2 clocks in my office, one I can see and one the client can see so we both can pace ourselves with what we want to address",
    "Ooh now I know what to suggest tor a birthday present to my friends!",
    "It is for sure! I\u2019m a big eye contact-maker but not constantly steady. I guess part of it is I\u2019ve gotten used to the pattern my therapists have of looking around. But it\u2019s definitely obvious when they look up high on the wall :) I think also knowing where the clock is is part of it too. There\u2019s a sense in which, at least for me, intended looks are different from just kind of gazing around. Hard to describe. I do appreciate the whole not having to like, turn around or look at a watch thing so that they can keep their attention on the conversation and not distract both of us by making some *super* obvious movement to look. \n\nAlso: your name amuses me even though I have no idea what it means. Makes me laugh anyway",
    "For sure! I try to look at the clock when my client is making their rounds around the room with their eyes, haha! \n\nLOL, my username is a reference to a show called Misfits (its on Hulu right now but its a British show), the gang needs a password and one of em says \"monkey slut\"",

    "Real talk. How many people actually heal themselves? Like go to long term therapy, journal, reflect, make big life changes and stick to them, forgive their self and others, learn to love their self etc etc. I feel like this pressure that this is what you\u2019re supposed to be doing at all times. If you\u2019re not working on yourself, healing yourself, you are somehow broken or lacking or lazy even. Hmm. I guess it all depends on your values and whether you want to tap into your full potential during this life. God that sounds so condescending.",
    "Interesting re-purposing of the psychedelic mushroom and awareness concept.  \n\nThis is what I say for people using Biofeedback - biofeedback shows you the awareness and gives you the response control; this is what allows someone to find the answers as in 'healing oneself', or in finding that extra 1% championship level performance or 10% stress reduction.",

I imagine the same goes for therapy, to an extent.",
    "And you can acquire the skills to do so without a therapist! Which many people don\u2019t seem to recognize.",
    "I don't healing is as black and white as something that can be accomplished per se - I think it's something to work on and try to maintain, and nobody should be judged for where they are or how much/little progress they're making. As for societal pressure, our culture is all about appearances which is such a harmful mentality. I think when people call others broken, lacking and lazy, it's that they're criticizing what they're ashamed of in themselves.",
    "By \u201cplay songs for me,\u201d I meant get on stage during my concerts and make the music I take credit for.\n\nI totally understand, though, the possible meaning you are referring to as well. I agree with you on that point.",

    "Exactly what's the point of a therapist if it's just about the skills? \n\n\nThere's tons of CBT/DBT self-help books. The relationship in therapy matters just as much imo but whatever",
    "Oh, yeah, I see.  Right, I don't expect my therapist to live my life for me. I think that's what your analogy means here, right?  It's not like he even could if he wanted to.",
    "I was making another point. Sometimes you don\u2019t need a therapist to work through things if you can find techniques yourself.",
    "Yeah, something like that. It\u2019s not just that they can\u2019t live your life, but they can\u2019t fix you because the fix is more often than not a matter of learned and practicing healthy behaviors and cognitions, just as a guitar player has to train themselves to hit chords and strum effectively.

In fact, the real-life mental health professional who inspired this comic is female. But given that these comics are a series, it just \u201creads\u201d easier if I keep the character consistent.",

    "Thank you for sharing. The language of non-compliance in the medical and mental health systems does so much harm and obscures the issues at the root of patients' perceived \"non-compliance.\" The threat of being labeled as such is also often held over people's heads and forces them to go along with treatment providers that are actually causing them harm or at least not helping. \n\n(For ex., if you're on disability at work, being labeled non-compliant could threaten your ability to remain on it, so instead of advocating for yourself you might have to go along with treatment that isn't a good fit for you or a provider who is causing you harm).",

    "Love this. This is probably one of the most important messages to share around in therapist communities. \n\nTherapists use a lot of psychobabble to move responsibility away from their competencies and push it on clients.

    "exactly what i told her.\n\ni\u2019m also a therapist and if a client needs to do something to meet their body\u2019s sensory needs, i would support and encourage them for engaging in a coping skill that helps them feel more calm and focused, thereby INCREASING their ability to successfully engage with the therapy. \n\nshe also said that if a client was becoming anxious and felt the need to stand up and walk around, she would tell them to sit down so she can \u201chelp them through the feeling\u201d instead of allowing them to reduce their anxiety. \n\nshe is also terminating with clients who don\u2019t want to return to in person therapy because she feels they are avoiding her and if they prefer telehealth then they are not willing to put in the effort for their therapy. so she is literally ending with them.\n\n\ni feel bad for her clients and i feel bad for myself for having to deal with her.",
    "If it makes you feel any better, I was once in a Zoom call with my T and I saw her elderly husband walk out of the bathroom in the nude in the background. I kept that to myself.",
    "My T and I both saw each other naked at the gym. Wasn\u2019t as embarassing as what you\u2019re describing, but maybe because it was both of us ?",
    "This may be the best/worst story of someone seeing their therapist outside of therapy that I've ever heard!",
    "Americans and nudity is just a weird combination lmao\n\nAs a German I don\u00b4t get why that would be sooooo bad\n\nYeah it\u00b4s a bit awkward but not really that bad imho",
    "On a serious note, as a therapist this wouldn't be a big deal at all to me. I'd want to give you your privacy, but it's just a body like each and every one of us has. Truly nothing to be embarrassed about!",
    "I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s the \u201cCAN WE EMDR THIS SHIT\u201d for me. I relate because ever since my course I go through life asking myself the same question",
    "Are you going to go back?! I\u2019m curious how she\u2019ll process this lol.",
    "Haha. You should totally make that last comment in session. If she\u2019s like me, she appreciate it.",
    "This is something you will really need to address in session. It wouldn't be helpful for you or the therapeutic relationship to avoid it. And some good may even come out of it. After this, what can you not discuss? What thoughts or feelings would you be unable to share? You literally have nothing more to hide.",
    "Don\u2019t worry\u2026 your T will also be thinking of it 30 years from now. Y\u2019all are now probably bonded for life!",
    "Wow. Just WOW. You\u2019re right, OP - you win. I just can\u2019t even. Shittiest contest ever, but you win. Idk what your prize is though! \ud83d\ude02 When do you see your T next?\n\nOT but I\u2019m prior military too, so I have a similar apathy about changing in front of others, haha such a random thing.",
    "Sorry but this post just made my day lol! I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.",
    "Welp OP. I'm sure during those hard sessions they said to let it all out, I don't think that's what they meant.",
    "This is fucking hilarious. Also horrifying, but mostly hilarious. That last line is killing me tho, lol.",
    "Oh. My. God. Yeah I think you did it. I think you won the gold medal in awful. I'm so sorry",
    "I can't wait to hear how you start off your next session. I'm sure she'll say \"think nothing off it\" \"I really didn't see anything\"... \n\nHow will you start though? \"I'm embarrassed that you saw all of my epidermis\"? \"Uhhhh so I'm guessing this session is free since you technically owe me for the show\"?",
    "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02ha",
    "Yes I agree you win. What are the odds??",
    "Oh wow... Uh I think you need a prize.",
    "I got dragged into a melee in session once.   Look at the bright side, it\u2019s a story to tell even if you wince.",
    "Oh my god. I would simply pass away. Good on you for finding the humour in it though!! (If you don\u2019t laugh you\u2019ll cry, right?)",
    "My T and I live in a city of 3MM people (not in the USA) and I've already addressed that I'm going to quietly nod to her and walk away if we see each other in public. She was a bit surprised by that, that it would likely never happen. I don't know her address but trust me, it'll happen. I run into people I know everywhere I go.\n\nAnyway, I'd DIE if she walked in on me in a locker room (I'm a M, but if I were a female, is what I mean). Maybe go into the next session with a paper bag over your head and try to laugh it off? that's what I would do. good luck!",
    "I hope y\u2019all can laugh about it in your next session. I imagine that\u2019s a first for you both!!! The one I saw my therapist in the wild, I ran up to her to say hi and \u201chi\u201d got flustered and felt like I was bothering her and immediately ran away. I still cringe/laugh about it today!",
    "Omg just laughed my ass off! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude4f\nSo sorry this happened to you! It's always fun to tell a story like that but I can imagine how embarrassing and uncomfortable that feels like in real life ... holy shit!\nI'm doing trauma therapy too so hahaha when you said can we emdr this I just thought that would have been my reaction too hahaha damn!",
    "Wow! I can only imagine the horror you felt at the time. For me, the only way to deal going forward would be to remind myself it is a locker room! I would prob end up laughing about it making a joke about it and definitely use the bathroom to change next time :) keep going to the same gym and maybe just discuss how and if you will acknowledge each other if you see one another in public! \nYou did win the gold medal though!!\nThank you for sharing and it is a reminder to all we are all human and things happen.",
    "For some reason, I think that would be fun. Maybe I just like being naked or shocking people though.",
    "How old is your therapist and how old are you?",
    "I had one who saw everything and never flinched.",
    "Vulnerability at its finest\u2026",
    "Is anyone else out there not relating? Maybe I've spent too much time naked in public, hot springs, saunas, hiking, festivals, the gym, seen many births, naked patients... I empathize with the emotion you're expressing OP, here to validate you, but I have to connect it to other cringe situations to relate. \n\nIt makes me sad honestly. Early influence in my life with midwives and hippie types taught me how to be comfortable in my own skin, in all my icky bits. Respect to those who can't, cptsd and other scars, but I wish everyone could get a taste of that wonderful free feeling at least once. It's been healing for me",
    "I would never see a therapist who might at all be in my gym or social circle.   It's a sign you're with a peer instead of a mentor.",
    "Yeeep, just gonna repress that. Lol.",
    "Oh my god \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
    "OMG. Did she say anything!?",
    "Is that considered trauma bonding? I would not be able to look at mine in the face after that, nor would I want her to look me in the eyes either lol.",
    "I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not in the US?",
    "I think maybe you\u2019re right... the playing field of vulnerability in your situation is totally level.",
    "Right?? Like suddenly my story of seeing mine at work isn't nearly so bad",
    "Oh for sure, it\u2019s definitely a cultural thing. Americans are so fucking weird about bodies and over-sexualize everything and then make it shameful.",
    "Met my European professor in the locker room once when he had just left the shower. He's a chill guy, chatted for a bit, then he grabbed a towel. Still really awkward though, longest \"don't look down\" moment of my life.",
    "Oh absolutely and that\u2019s definitely what she did. It\u2019s just one of those \u201coh my god are you serious\u201d things. Of all the possible things on planet earth that could have happened in that moment, my T seeing me stark naked was literally the last thing I expected.",
    "I agree. I don\u2019t see what the big deal is.",
    "True dat",
    "I\u2019m legit going to ask her next week \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
    "Came here to say this!! I literally snorted when I read that!!",
    "SAME! \ud83d\ude29 I\u2019m definitely going back bc she\u2019s great, but I might have to have a blanket over my head for the duration of our time together \ud83d\ude02",
    "I 100% am going to. I deal with uncomfortable shit via humor, so I know she\u2019ll get a kick out of it.",
    "Oh for sure, I\u2019ll definitely bring it up. And you have a good point!",
    "Is this considered a trauma bond? Asking for a friend! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
    "I see her next week! And yup, you know the drill from the military. It\u2019s all the same essentially. Naked in front is a bunch of strangers on the regular. But it being my therapist is so different",
    "Same same same \ud83d\udc4f",
    "Haha honestly!! I approach most things with humor, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have something clever to say in session next week. I have to immediately bring it up or it\u2019ll be the elephant in the room!",
    "I should take these kinds of odds to Vegas!",
    "Exactly!",
    "Exactly!",
    "Right, like can we EMDR all the embarrassing shit I\u2019ve ever done in my life, but let\u2019s start with this one \ud83d\ude02",
    "Oh yeah, definitely bringing it up. Now that I\u2019ve slept on it, it\u2019s at the \u201ccringe but funny\u201d point. When I told my best friend (who is also in therapy so we often share stories), she laughed so hard she cried. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
    "I\u2019m 34 and my T is 60.",
    "Weird flex",
    "I mean I don\u2019t really mind being seen in general had it been literally anyone else.",
    "I mean I\u2019ve never run into her elsewhere, she\u2019s 30 years older than me, she\u2019s not in my social circle or peer group. We just happened to unknowingly go to the same gym/yoga studio.",
    "Even if you live somewhere as big as Manhattan, there\u2019s still a good chance you might accidentally run into your therapist out and about somewhere - including at the gym. Especially if you see a therapist who works within a short drive of your home. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a peer, just that you two live in the same city. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
    "Mentors don't go to gyms?",
    "How on earth do you figure that? If you live in a small town chances are you're going to run into your T going about their daily life as you're going about yours. It doesn't mean anything",
    "The fact that your therapist goes to your gym would be a sign that they\u2019re a peer? How are you possibly finding out beforehand whether you belong to the same gym?\n\nAnd since when are therapists supposed to be mentors?",
    "I didn't know a T couldn't be a peer",
    "I'm almost certain she didn't see / notice.",
    "I don\u2019t see how it would be. Our next session was just as casual, highlighting how we were surprised to see each other, and the importance of being physically active (same type of convo you\u2019d have with a friend/acquaintance in sinilar circumstances?).",
    "Indeed, what gave it away?",
    "Boobs, for instance. Don\u2019t even get me started lol",
    "When I used to go to the Y pre-covid, I always mentally prepared myself for the possibility of a naked client because I knew a bunch went there lol",
    "Completely tangential, but it's weird that people are this prudish about nudity right? I mean not individually weird, but weird as a society. Like, it's just a meat mech.",
    "Good luck, op! May the eye always roll in your favour! \ud83d\udc40",
    "Omg please update us on how it goes, if you feel comfortable. \ud83d\ude05",
    "Oh for sure!",
    "Hahaha I feel you OP \ud83d\ude06",
    "My life is weird. : )",
    "I understand. Upon further reflection I remembered when a university art student friend asked to paint me nude because I am an older curvy mama type, not the typical androgynous fit people who volunteer for their classes. When I heard from a co-worker that the piece was for sale and hanging in a local coffee shop I felt the cringe! Humbly, I had forgot about that!",
    "Well, if you're about the same age,  same sex, same interests (yoga), it could have been predicted. I'd prefer not to be too close to the same as my therapist. It's just a personal choice.   And not mentor... more like someone more objective than a peer would be.",
    "Maybe that\u2019s for the best \ud83d\ude02",
    "You two are some brave and confident folks. I guess in my situation, it would not happy in the first place because there\u2019s no way I would get naked in a public environment but they handled that very well! I personally would never want to see my therapist again after that lol.",
    "People are much more prudish about nudity here",
    "Haha I bet there\u2019s all sorts of stuff you have to mentally prepare for as a therapist going \u201cout into the wild\u201d.",
    "Oh it\u2019s definitely weird/shitty. Especially in America, where we make it so taboo, but then oversexualize everything to the point of shame. Like I said in my OP, I am very used to changing or showering in a group shower from marine corps barracks and whatnot, so in general it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. It was more just the fact that my therapist got an eyeful of my T&A while I\u2019m in the post-yoga zen state.",
    "I agree that it's weird. I dont care if other people see me naked. I dont want people to see me if they dont want to, so I close my curtains and whatnot. But if someone sees or wants to see me I dont mind lol.",
    "I definitely will!",
    "So you're suggesting that people should avoid seeing a therapist who's the same sex and similar age as they are?  That's very rigid, and often impossible.  And you wouldn't typically know your therapist's interested, so that wouldn't work either.\n\nUltimately, it's always a possibility that you'll run into your therapist.",

I often struggle to share feelings of transference with my therapist too\u2014when she had a baby, I struggled so much cos lowkey \u201cI want to be your baby\u201d, \u201cwhy does your baby get so much time and not me\u201d. So yep, this tugged a few heartstrings.\n\nThank you for making me feel less alone in this alone world \u2764\ufe0f",
    "i\u2019m feeling like this right now, should i do the same thing? what\u2019s going to happen?",
    "Could someone please explain to me how this is transference? \nI have just a little experience with therapy and have heard of transference but in a different context.",
    "Hey, can any therapists talk about how you handle this situation? I'm in my psych undergrad and I am worried about this.",
    "Kinda seems like OP is doing a sort of crowdsourced accountability of her therapist but keeping us updated on how he reacts to all of this.",
    "your comics are the best",
    "Unrelated to the contents, but you're really good at drawing hands and capturing expressions.",
    "Hahaha I love this",
    "Wow I wasn't expecting to relate so hard to this, that's exactly how I feel towards my T too. I've been feeling like such a freak about it.",
    "Does your therapist know you make these comics? Wonder what they think about it",
    "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re still in this situation. I hope you get some quality therapy eventually.",
    "So relatable!",
    "I really like this art style.",
    "So real XD",
    "I really appreciate your comics. I used to draw a lot of comics to cope but kind of fell out of it. I\u2019ve started again because you\u2019ve reminded me how powerful they can be :)",
    "I was so worried about this happening to me when I started therapy- I\u2019m delighted to report that I only want to be her best friend \ud83d\ude39",
    "u/lookingatposts you\u2019re not the only one",
    "Omg OP, stop leaving me on all these cliffs!",
    "You are an amazing artist. I wish I had a fraction of the skills you do. I\u2019d absolutely love to see more of your art with a different story line.\n\nBut I really think you need to be in therapy with a woman instead due to your ongoing transference.  If y\u2019all had a longer working relationship than a few months I might think differently. Or if this wasn\u2019t a pattern with you or  such a heavy focus. \n\nThis is getting uncomfortable from all angles. How about if this was a dude repeatedly telling his female therapist how he wanted to fuck her? Not okay.",
    "Weird",
    "I'm guessing the point is that all those concepts are connected?\n\nLove the art style.",
    "Second this! How did he react?!",
    "Its the weirdest struggle! I want my T to be a parent and like nurture me and care for me. But I also want to have sex with her. Shit is so goddamn weird",
    "Also they hands are fantastic \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c",
    "Therapists are used to clients bringing up transference issues and are typically trained with how to respond.  An ethical therapist may allow the client to share their feelings then they could explain how romantic transference is not an uncommon thing for clients to experience.  They may then opt to discuss things like how the client may be looking for intimacy from a nonjudgemental and safe source which is why these emotions can spill out towards a professional.  Think about it, the therapist may be showing more kindness and interest than a client has ever gotten from their personal relationships simply because the therapist is trained to discuss very personal things in a supportive atmosphere.  It is no wonder some clients fall for their therapist and they often find it helpful to talk about it with them.  \n\nHowever, I saw a post regarding romantic transference the other day where the therapist kept prompting the client to go into deep detail on their sexual fantasies of the therapist.  It seemed like the therapist could be filling their own ego and desires when encouraging detailed accounts of the sexual fantasies.  Transference issues are completely normal and can even be expected but they can be tricky to navigate in discussing the transference while maintaining boundaries and the integrity of healing.",
    "Transference is when the client wants to play out a dynamic with their therapist, which they otherwise would\u2019ve played out with someone else. \nFor example, here, the person says they want their therapist to adopt them. So the person is transferring feelings they have for their parents towards their therapist.",
    "He knows. He really enjoys reading them and thinks they\u2019re pretty great.",
    "Idk why you are getting downvoted. If anyone looks at OP's post history, this dude is taking advantage of them BIG time.",
    "Oh yay I'm glad to know my comics are inspiring others. I'd love to see yours!",
    "Doesn't always work that way. I have a female therapist and I'm a straight woman. I still want my T to adopt me and to have sex with me",
    "Not sure why you got downvoted. You\u2019re obviously going off of previous comics that raised red flags. I enjoy all these comics but her therapist has been acting inappropriately...",
    "Before downvoting, people need to look at OP's post history. Their therapist has crossed so many boundaries and seems downright creepy.\n\n>when we started talking about dating. He suggested I go to social gatherings and find someone there, strike up a conversation. Since I like older men, he said I should probably go up to them (\"since you hold the power. You have all the tools. It will be easy for you. If it were me trying to approach a young woman, that would be much harder.\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He started speaking in this fatherly way that I never experienced before, about how when I do choose to have sex, make sure it's with someone that I really, really care for and that it's my choice and never, ever have unprotected sex. Don't let anyone inside of me without protection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We also discussed pornography that session and I told him how I don't like how I feel after watching it. He asked me why I watch it. And I replied, \"to get off on it\" and he asked to clarify whether I masturbate to it. And I said yes. Then he asked me what kind.\n\nNone of this is normal or healthy. I really hope op stays safe and finds a better therapist.",
    "I can't remember exactly, but this is the gist of it. \n\nHe ended up steering the conversation to the self and said that my fantasies aren't really that important to the bigger picture of who I am and my purpose, he also recognized that he and the last guy I had a crush on were/are filling the role of a positive male role model that I didn't have while growing up. \n\nWe keep coming back to the subject of transference. And he's pretty certain it will go away within a couple months, but he did leave it open and said that it might be a good idea to consider a female therapist because he thinks transference slows down the therapeutic process somewhat. I asked him if he was concerned about it and he said no. He trusts that I'll make the right decision in regards to my treatment and that he knows himself well enough and promised that I will never be taken advantage of within our therapeutic setting. He said our relationship will always be therapist/client until he dies.",
    "Funniest part about it is that they can provide neither!",
    "Tony Soprano vibes.",
    "[deleted]",
    "Ohh, thank you for explaining. That makes sense. I didn't get that the person was implying adoption because I related to the comic differently.",
    "Unpopular opinion here. I thinking saying the therapist taking advantage of them big time is a big stretch to make. Maybe some of the things the therapist said could of been phrased better. But when your discussing porn reliance and transference talking it out is how you figure it out. Things like porn preference and fantasy\u2019s tie in a lot with that. Just because the client is crushing on the Therapist doesn\u2019t mean the client shouldnt be able to move forward and discuss these things to better understand their porn use and their transference.",
    "I might share! I\u2019m a little worried about anonymity buuut I do want to share. :)",
    "True, but if you history is intense attraction to off limits male authority figures, it might make sense to avoid replaying the scenario",
    "Funniest but I think also most healing. If I texted my T and said I wanna have wild monkey sex with you it would trigger a very mortifying conversation, or perhaps several. But I know she would never *ever* act on it. It makes the therapeutic relationship a really safe place to talk about this stuff because I know no matter what I offer she will never do the things I want her to do. I don't have to worry about my feelings for her being taken advantage off",
    "I took a quick dive into their history and wow, this therapist has crossed so many boundaries and seems a bit predatory. I really hope OP stays safe.",
    "Let me know if I'm wrong, but you might have missed the full comic. There are 4 sets, and the last one mentions adoption.",
    "These are good points. But based on comments, I believe there was a post with more inappropriate things (therapist giving compliments to OP, telling them to seek out older men, etc.)\n\nEdit: I thought the post was deleted but I guess it's not",
    "Maybe try it on a new account?",
    "no point, because they can't avoid male authority figures forever. family elders, a boss at their job, a doctor, there's always gonna be someone. so i think it's best to work through it with a therapist who's equipped to deal with it, instead of staying forever confused by these feelings. they're not gonna just disappear. \n\nand there are men on this sub who talk about sexual transference towards their female Ts and they always seem very embarrassed by these feelings, so there's no need to say things like in your first comment to shame them more",
    "If you were my client, I'd ask you about what you are getting out of the therapeutic relationship that is so special...I always approach the parent and/or sexual attachment feelings as an expression of an unmet need...What are you craving from your childhood?   What do you wish you had in your partner?   \n\nAlmost every time, the client feels like the therapist listens, hears them, and cares about their wellbeing...and they didn't even realize that this was something that they wished they'd gotten more of from their parents in the past or their partners in the present and more recent past.   \n\nHopefully, your therapist is skilled enough to use that transference to help you seek those aspects in your non-therapy relationships -- to express your needs and have a realistic expectation that in a healthy relationship your needs will be adequately met.",
    "Whoops! You're right, I didn't swipe at all. Hahaha, thanks for that!",
    "I wasn\u2019t suggesting OP avoid male authority figures, just that she would probably be able to better navigate that pattern with someone who wasn\u2019t the object of her desire. \n\nI sincerely do not intend to shame anyone and I apologize if it reads that way. I will try to chose my words more carefully. \n\nI still stand by my statement that you all may feel differently if a female therapist was posting and saying about how her male patient texted her saying he wanted to fuck her. Reads as inappropriate. \n\nI do feel like there is a large trend in this community to focus on the therapeutic relationship (mainly transference of emotional and sexual feelings) towards the therapists instead of the actual content or personal growth and insights gleaned from therapy.",
    "I'd suggest googling \"erotic transference\" in therapy. This type of transference is normal and yes, healthy, in therapy. And yes, you ARE supposed to talk about it. A good therapist can handle the conversation because they have been trained to. Transference is part of therapy. It's necessary for  therapy to work. It's not a distraction or something that gets in the way. It's a part of therapeutic work. And erotic transference is just another form of transference. This has been well-known going all the way back to Freud.",
    "It's definitely better handled in this type of scenario if that's even the right word haha. Better dealt with in a situation with a trained professional who knows how to handle this and is trained in helping a client learn to deal with it. You can't avoid people forever. I get transference towards women old enough to be my mother. Guess what there are tons of them and I can't avoid them forever. Better dealt with in therapy than in a situation that could get seriously messy",

    "Accurate",
    "\"I don't know\" --  i was raised to think i was always wrong, whenever I was asked a question, it was always a trap.  So I went from knowing reality and what i felt, to doubting reality and what i felt, finally to waiting for my abuser to tell me what reality is and what i feel.  Therapist should be letting you know this if he is doing the above. If not let them know.  It is a harmful, a very similar to the tactics that lead \"I don't know\" to be a staple response in the first place.",
    "With my therapist it was always - \u201cDon\u2019t know or don\u2019t want to say?\u201d Made me both feel seen and challenged me - Really helped me ... got me talking about not wanting to talk about things, which involved acknowledging the presence of Things, which gave us a direction to move towards since usually wanting to move away from something was a sign that it could be healing to go towards it.. plus also held me build my assertiveness in therapy, where I could practice clearly expressing I didn\u2019t want to do something. After a while it me feel kinda powerful sometimes to say I didn\u2019t want to say, even if it caused all the feelings to have the ball in my court",

    "Yeah, I would find it incredibly frustrating.  If I say \"I don't know\" then, at least at that moment, I *don't* know.  And I have a thing about not being believed, especially when it comes to this kind of thing.  (I grew up with undiagnosed ADHD, and very uneven academic performance, so I got a lot of people not believing me about what I didn't know or didn't understand, and assuming I was just lying to be difficult.)  \n\nHaving someone help me figure out the answers would be one thing, because sometimes it's that I'm too stressed to figure out or remember the answer right then, or I'm having trouble knowing where to start when it comes to figuring it out.  But having someone flat-out *tell* me they didn't believe me would be extremely unhelpful.",
    "I can relate to not knowing reality because of gaslighting and to saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d because I genuinely don\u2019t know reality. I think this meme is calling out people (like myself) who say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d out of avoidance.",
    "Me too. Its such a process.",
    "I find it hilarious hahahaha!! My T is the same as yours in that she knows when I do know but just can\u2019t articulate it and is challenging me to dig. She recognizes the times where I\u2019m genuinely confused and/or distressed and will not respond that way during those times.",
    "I\u2019m honest. If I do know I\u2019ll say it. I\u2019m straight forward which is why I find that comment to be super frustrating.",
    "i think T is fair in responding to the avoidance as such, but client should be informed and (maybe reminded depending on client) that the avoidance response is a coping mechanism, is nothing to be ashamed of, but in order to continue with the issue at hand  the therapist asks that client asks to overcome that and proffer an opinion.  I've had a therapist who responded in the same way, and actually shamed me afterwards saying I was not trying at all (I replication of the abuse which lead to the coping mechanism).  Your meme is calling out \"therapy is hard\" and the therapist sometimes has to push us. But not every client knows that  \"i think you do know\" shouldn't be a shaming too.  Not ever T knows this.",
    "That\u2019s fair. I am also very honest when I don\u2019t know. I agree, that comment certainly wouldn\u2019t be helpful in those instances.",

    "I made my T cry once and was like \"holy shit, didn't know that was possible\". It made me feel like she really cared and was genuine. It also made me less ashamed of crying in front of her",
    "Tbh sometimes i get a little sad when i cry in therapy sessions and my therapist just sits there quietly watching me till i get a little calmer, and either of us break the silence. Sometimes i want someone to cry too and validate how bad i feel. \n\nBut maybe she\u2019s been in the business so long (waaaay before i was born) that she\u2019s just jaded, or holds herself well & knows per her professional experience that being over-emotional with an over-emotional patient doesn\u2019t help? I don\u2019t know... the neutrality just makes me feel like my issues aren\u2019t bad enough, or pale very much in comparison to her other patients, I guess. Like, what if I\u2019m depressed for some tiny shitty reason that\u2019s basically a waste of her time?\n\nAt least she gave me a hug at our most recent session, after I asked for it. It was one of those \u201cyou got this\u201d hugs, even though I very much *don\u2019t got this*.",
    "I made a former therapist get extremely tearful to the point where he made a fist and used his thumb to apply direct pressure to his forehand in between his eyes to avoid crying. \n\nBut honestly with my current therapist I just want him to make a direct comment of some kind about my appearance. The man ha never commented on a single outfit or drastic hair change.",

    "I don't equate crying with pity. They're not the same at all.",
    "Yeah I've read that showing emotions like these to your patient can force them to have to feel like they now are responsible for the therapist's emotions, which does not sound very therapeutic. I think the therapist is there unconditionally for their patient's emotions, not the other way around. I can imagine this is not a universally bad practice but generally it seems like a bad idea.",
    "It's a joke.",
    "Well it's a joke, but yeah it would feel like they care.",
    "A former counselor of mine cried when I was crying while bringing up something that happened in my childhood. I thought it was sweet, but my underlining trust issues got triggered badly, in a way that I didn\u2019t even realize. Little things like that built up and lead to a huge rupture and then termination. Was not something I could handle.",
    "Either way, I wouldn't want my therapist crying",
    "There is a difference between witnessing someone else\u2019s emotions and feeling responsible for them. If the therapist burst into tears early on in the process because of a sad story, that would indeed be a problem. But if the work has included the exploration of the fact that we are all responsible for our own emotions and no one else\u2019s, and this has been underlined by the therapist being boundaried about how they are feeling, then a controlled expression of empathic tears could be healing for someone who has not experienced it previously. Tears do not necessarily equate with pity. Pity is not empathic. Empathy comes from a place of truly caring and understanding.",
    "That makes sense. Thanks for the input.",
    "Too true. It\u2019s like, why are you treating me with respect, dignity, and compassion? What are you up to?",
    "I adore my psychologist. After working with her for a year now, it feels less sketchy and more like a magical secret that no one else in my life could understand (they\u2019ve never done long-term therapy).",
    "Hahaha dead. You are telling me my feelings are valid? I don't trust you. Fails to make another appointment until therapist sends email reminder.",
    "I feel seen.",
    "He\u2019s gonna blow up on me eventually..",
    "I wouldn't say \"I find it hard to trust\" cause then it makes it your problem.  I think a way of looking at it that respects you more is that \"I find it very rare that people earn my trust.\"",
    "Trust is so hard \n\nThe whole idea of therapy and trust is weird. Like let me go into a room with someone I've never met before and spill all my secret pain. All the ways I've been hurt in the past all of it \n\nMy T literally knows things about me my own family doesn't know. It's just a weird as hell situation. Also doesn't help i came in with some pretty hefty trust issues",
    "I'm still having a hard time trusting mine, due to communication issues sometimes. Ie they are moving and taking insurance in the future I found out inadvertently through a website they advertise their services on. They never said anything about taking insurance for new clients when prior I had concerns about paying for Therapy recently due to income change and was told try every other week if needed (I pay cash). \nKind of really hurt to realize after. \n\nOtherwise being open and crying in front of a stranger is tough. Took about 3 months to talk about any substance. Self disclosure on their part helped.",
    "I feel so seen. I\u2019m still unable to completely trust mine. I don\u2019t think the time-limited nature neither of us can do anything about helps either, and I have severe trust issues. She\u2019s really nice but I\u2019m just waiting for the other shoe to drop and be fucked over.\n\n\nTrust is more difficult than I can put in words.\n\n\nSlightly off topic but Schitt\u2019s Creek is my favourite show. Absolutely brilliant.",
    "Agreed.\n\nGreat show. I fiddle with my hair too. It's my nervous habit, haha.",
    "Hmm. This is really interesting and something I\u2019ve been mulling over. Not about my counsellor, but a guy I met through online dating and have been chatting with.\n\nHe\u2019a been openly consistent with me and not afraid of my emotions or thoughts or doubts. It probably helps that he\u2019s passionate about mental health and is training to become a counsellor himself. \n\nBut if he tells me something personal about himself, he\u2019ll ask at the end if I have any questions. It sounds kind of clinical, and it probably is, but it\u2019s strange to hear such openness from a potential person I could date, when in the past, most potential partners are SO closed off - it\u2019s liking pulling teeth. \n\nIt does make me feel a bit weird, because I\u2019ve never been given space like that with someone I could romantically be involved with.\n\nAnyway, this post kind of helped to explain some of my anxiety recently.",

    "Aww, cows are the best! I'm happy you were able to have such a great experience. This is the wholesome content I'm here for!\n\nMeanwhile... my therapist would probably be like, \"*Why are you avoiding your issues by making a PowerPoint about cows?*\" \ud83d\ude02",
    "This is so wholesome and motivational to be open with a therapist no matter how crazy it sounds in the 1st place.",
    "On a related note, when I\u2019m having a hard time, I drive out to a nature preserve that has some cows out there and just watch them. Right now the calves are out too and I love watching them nurse. These cows don\u2019t let humans get too close, but it\u2019s still therapeutic! I\u2019m happy you got to cuddle a cow!",

    "That's amazing. I didn't consider cow therapy but they're cuddly enough that it makes sense for some calm time with them. I was teaching my therapist about hippotherapy in the last few sessions because it's my volunteering gig of choice - seeing students become more communicative or able to sit up unassisted through lessons through riding while I get to help and hang with horses is amazing.",
    "I love you! I love your therapist!",
    "LMAOO that\u2019s amazing",
    "My therapist used to let me in while she ran to the bathroom, so I bet this would be a way haha",
    "As a therapist, my first response is: just talk to them about it (my second thought is: and you know this is going to turn into a conversation about caretaking ;) ) But as a plant lover I say you need to water the plants :)",
    "My first thought after reading the 400k views was that she was doxxing herself, but if she put it on TikTok in the first place I suppose that was a little bit the point",

    "My T does this too! I never thought about using that as a way to sneakily add positive things in her office though haha.",
    "Funny story. My parents didn\u2019t know I was in therapy. A national news show picked the story up and aired it last week so um that was a fun way to tell them I was in therapy \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
    "My therapist said \"I think you wish to be the kind of person you can rely on\", and I've been thinking about that ever since. Completely recontextualised how I view repeating harmful behaviours.\n\nI'll keep your comic as a reminder of that.",

    "lol",
    "Can you elaborate? Are you saying you would repeat harmful behaviors (ie overextending yourself I\u2019m guessing, maybe trying to be there for everyone?) because ultimately you saw those actions as ways to be the \u201creliable one\u201d? (Curious tone, not a nasty tone :)   )",
    "Yep. Shortly after this conversation with my T I told him about this short haha",
    "My T wasn\u2019t telling me to not feel stressed or anxious or depressed. He was telling me I have the power to not do the same behavioral mistake twice.",
    "No, I mean something entirely different. It's about relying on yourself, not other people relying in you. \n\nHer comment arose from a similar situation as in the comic. I said I'm afraid of repeating a certain action, she said \"then don't repeat it\". I went on a rant about how it's not that easy, and she pointed out this means I can't rely upon myself. I don't keep promises toward myself. It's about giving myself the same level of reliability that I give to, and expect from others. It made me view my behaviour in a different light. Before, I always viewed it as \"I have to be disciplined\", and now, I see it as \"I want to be a good friend to myself\". It has helped me make healthier choices, because they're not chores, they're acts of love and friendship.",
    "I also don\u2019t like to call things \u201cchores\u201d anymore (I found out it\u2019s a trigger word for me because of my childhood).\n\nI saw someone refer to them as \u201ccare tasks\u201d instead and it forever changed the way I approach things.\n\nI\u2019m not having to do them because I\u2019m being forced to do them (like I was as a child), but I am having to do them because they are ways to care for myself and those around me.\n\nIt\u2019s helped. Maybe it\u2019s helpful for someone here. \ud83d\udc95",
    "OH!!!! Yes, that makes *way* hella more sense! And now I need to go have a Come to Jesus talk with myself....",
    "To add some dorkiness, sometimes I say things like \"I'm here for you\" to myself, out loud. It's a reminder  *and* a promise.  I do it even for small things, like when I crave snacks but I promised myself to be healthy. It's not a cure-all, just one element of some extensive therapy I've been doing, but it's been a helpful step I can take any time.",

    "Yep.  And this doesn't mean that people *can't* go to therapy if they want to.   I think therapy should be available for anyone who wants it.  But regardless of whether one chooses therapy or not, it's helpful to recognize what it *doesn't* do.",
    "I\u2019m sorry, downvote me into oblivion for this, but who on earth is advocating that therapy will fix systemic socio economic issues?  Therapy doesn\u2019t help racism, classism, nor does it help the economy.  There\u2019s systemic issues around accessing therapy in and of itself.  So\u2026 who on earth is making this claim?  This to me is like trying to conflate two separate issues that don\u2019t cause/correlate.",
    "It\u2019s called \u201crealistic depression\u201d and \u201crealistic anxiety,\u201d and it\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019ve largely worked for organizations that pay me to give away my services.\n\nFair warning to aspiring helpers though - it\u2019s a tough way to make a living.",
    "Might not \"solve\" it but can help folks recognize it's unhealthy for them and take steps to set boundaries and move jobs if that's an option. Or at least find support and coping.",
    "Therapists then will say: if you \u201cfix\u201d your outlook (aka your not depressed) then it will translate in your work, how you work, which maybe will be rewarded and you\u2019ll get paid more.\n\nOr at the very least, not as miserable while being a wage slave.\n\nIn theory at least.",
    "But being overworked and underpaid can make it awfully hard to find time or money to do therapy.\n\nJust like poverty can prevent access to antidepressants. Huzzah capitalism.",
    "I feel like this comic is somewhat anti-therapy. I'm sorry. Feel free to downvote me. But it just feels hurtful to those of us who are in therapy. \n\nI absolutely agree that something as individual level as therapy is not going to end systemic issues like racism. So I get the underlying premise of this comic. But the way the message seems to be coming across is \"Hey! Therapy is useless because it won't fix these issues.\"",
    "I'm not sorry but that picture is stupid. \nTired of being overworked and underpaid get a new job stop settling for shit. \nAnd of course antidepressants won't help poverty",
    "There are literally so many good high paying jobs where you are not being overworked or underpaid you just have to find them. people settle for less because they don't want to take the time to fill out an application because it's too long. That's what happens when you're lazy. Most jobs purposely make applications long to weed out lazy people.",
    "Well, I\u2019ll say when I stopped blaming external forces I couldn\u2019t control and started working on what I was and wasn\u2019t doing to reach towards my ideal life, things flipped completely for me.  For me, driving a 2000 Honda Civic to a 2018 Lincoln Navigator and living in a 570 sqft apartment to a 5300 sqft house.  If you work your life aims in small incremental moves in an upward trajectory the results are powerful like compound interest.",
    "Oh man just think of that. Families across the world would be so much healthier if they could do that WHILE paying the Ts a good wage and not over working them. Won't happen but a wonderful thought.",
    "I think what they\u2019re trying to say is that for a lot of the reason that people are depressed is due to socio-economic issues that can\u2019t be therapied away. Therapy can help with your outlook but it can\u2019t help with getting a sustainable wage or being financially comfortable etc.",
    "This is just a response to something that's an unspoken expectation that the institution of therapy seems to present. CBT as a modality is a good example because it targets the thoughts you have as the source of the problem instead of the cause of some of those thoughts as the real issue. Therapy is also something that is is recognized as something that is largely acquired by people with privilege (money, access) and mostly lacking in diversity because many of the founders of modern psychology and the modalities are white, and there is a noted lack of therapists who are people of color in the industry itself. If you're looking for someone who is making this claim, its largely poor people of color who dont have access to therapy or who are being told that its their fault they are depressed or that if they could only change their thoughts they would get better. Being told largely by white therapists.",
    "That is true but a lot of people who experience these systemic issues are told to go to therapy and learn how to cope, and maybe that can be thought of as making the systemic issues about the person, a gaslight action, maybe?",
    "Same here. Loved reading the comic /meme but thought: \"That can't be a hot take, thats a very good but also very basic take.\" At least I thought everyone was in the same page on that one...",
    "The \"people need mental health counseling\" line that gets thrown around in the news every time something terrible happens really does perpetuate this. Putting the entire responsibility on the individual (oh they just need counseling) rather than seeing the collective system involved in creating such a situation. It's a both/and. Yes individuals need and deserve support and help. AND We also need to acknowledge (and hopefully work collectively to correct) the larger systems that create so much stress/imbalance on the individual. \n\nFor example, take a medical resident that commits suicide. Everyone says \"oh that person needed counseling.\" Hell yes that person needed support and counseling. AND the administration that creates incredible demands for this person, the family system that puts achievement over health, the hospital system that puts profits over well being of employees....ALL of that needs to be addressed too.",
    "A lot of therapists understand because they're paid shit wages with high caseloads. There's no reward, just more work when another person quits.",
    "They often say how we think of ourselves is what we look for. If we think we can't do much right because of how we were raised we won't try hard to get that job that requires a bit extra training with a bit more responsibility but pays way better. Or we won't be self employed because we don't think we have what it takes. I totally agree with what you are saying!",
    "It's more of an answer to the people that tell you to get therapy whenever you have any kind of complaint.",
    "Hey congrats on getting lucky and/or already knowing someone who got your foot in the door.",
    "Correct, though helping with the outlook can also be a swing and a miss. I remember once going in and agonizing to my therapist that I didn't think I was cut out for my current career but had no other marketable skills. He then told me, in all seriousness, that the only limit to what we earn *is what we decide to make it*. I remember looking at him, literally doing a face palm, and saying that his was an *awfully* libertarian point of view. (In hindsight, there were probably better insults that would apply to the pov he shared.)\n\nI then asked whether all the struggling people in our society (the US) were just not thinking big enough. He backtracked and said he just meant to refer to me, not them. \n\nI guess given that he found a profession where people pay him a lot of money per hour, out of pocket, to share that kind of wisdom, it's no wonder that he doesn't quite understand the difficulty of some people's financial struggles.",
    "Pretty much my impression, yeah.  Like obviously there *are* situations where an individual might be helped in solving issues like economic struggles or draining job conditions.   But I've known a lot of people who get really burned out and self-blaming due to \"You, individually, can solve all your problems if you just work on yourself enough!\", and for issues that are more systematic, it can be helpful to recognize the problem is not *individual unwillingness* to make positive changes.\n\n(Also, I feel like there's sometimes a significant gap in people's experiences around attitudes towards therapy that can make something which is really relatable for some people just confusing for others.  In most of the social environments I've been in, the norms can be intensely, almost *aggressively* pro-therapy, in a way that feels weirdly entangled with things like the wellness industry.  And for people who've heard a lot of that, it can be immensely helpful to explicitly acknowledge the limitations of therapy.)",
    "It wasn't a hot take to me. It's what I was taught when I earned my MSW 15 years ago. I understand and resonate with it though. Here in the US, positive psychology and others like CBT can easily make it feel like a better life is entirely within an individual's control, when many issues that impact mental health are entirely systemic and 100% tied to colonialism",
    "That wasn\u2019t meant as a burn on therapists if that is why I was downvoted.\n\nIt\u2019s more of a comment that therapists that I\u2019ve encountered don\u2019t (or can\u2019t?) analyze with an anti-capitalist perspective.\n\nA lot of the responsibilities are on the individual, and not the systems, which itself is very disappointing.\n\nThe current global economies can\u2019t function without oppressed people who believe they aren\u2019t enough to some degree. \n\nAnd it\u2019s demoralizing & disappointing & depressing",
    "Yeah, recognizing that therapy has limits and isn't an all-purpose solution isn't claiming it has *no* value and it isn't an attack on people who choose to do therapy.",
    "Naw I won\u2019t let you off with that, I could easily still be living in that same place with that same car and the same job that kept me there.  I worked to get all this, lucky?  I made this happen, cause I visualize the life I wanted and when opportunities showed up that I wouldn\u2019t grab before I did now.  You have more power over your life than you might think.  I make 10 year goals and accomplish them in a 10th of the time.  All this cause I took responsibility for my life, no one came and saved me.  It all started when I started watching Jordan Peterson\u2019s old lectures.  They spoke to me, but believe what you want about how helpless you are and how you need to be born into family wreath or \u201clucky\u201d.  Bear your burdens, have some aims.  Do you want quality friends?  An intimate relationship? Better job? I said yes to all these things.  It was hard at first but damn it, I\u2019m fucking doing it and I\u2019m proud of myself!",

    "It\u2019s a good tool. My T is a huge fan. I actually had a pillow custom made for her with the wheel on it so now she just throws it at me when she wants me to \u201cdescribe my feelings\u201d and if I\u2019m mad at her for making me describe my feelings I throw it back.",
    "My response every time my T asks how I'm feeling is - \"I don't know.\" When they hand me the wheel, I will point to whichever makes sense to me. It's a start I guess.",
    "It helps me a good bit when I'm having trouble identifying my feelings (which is often, bc I'm autistic). I still struggled with it at first, but over time I've gotten better at figuring my feelings out without the wheel. Sometimes my therapist does have to remind me that it exists and is an option though, lol.",
    "I actually have a feelings wheel pillow. I partly got it for my kids, since naming feelings is an important thing to help them learn to do (something I definitely never got growing up lol). But I use it just as much for myself. I often have trouble naming how I\u2019m feeling, beyond just \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cupset\u201d, and the wheel helps me learn more nuanced words to use. (This is something I do outside of therapy. It hasn\u2019t come up in therapy before.)",
    "My T called me out on using flowery words for feelings to distance myself from them. It took a lot of effort verbally to finally funnel down to a base emotion.  We introduced the feelings wheel so that I could work on acknowledging and giving space to my emotions.",
    "[deleted]",
    "You may not find this helpful because these are not empirically based distinct emotions. Note that one of the core feelings is \"Bad.\" Check out work by [Caroll Izard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Izard) on discrete emotions. Our emotions are helpful when we can accurately identify them. Misidentifying emotions may be worse than doing nothing.",
    "I find it very useful, especially when I want to be more specific than just \"sad\" or \"happy\" or whatever, but struggle with doing it. For me, getting more specific is really helpful in identifying the roots of the feeling. Like if I'm able to idebtity the difference between whether or not I'm frustrated or annoyed, rather than just generally \"angry,\" it helps me address that emotion more productively rather than maybe just stewing in it. \n\nYou mentioned in one of your comments that you disagree with some of the classifications. If be curious what your therapist thinks about that. To me, a fellow non-therapist, I want to say that it's totally legit to disagree, but I don't know. I think I would mention that.  It might lead to some good discussion that helps your T understand how you process your emotions.",
    "My therapist recently introduced this to me and I\u2019m still struggling with it, looking to see how people use it or break it down in session.",
    "My therapist uses this with me quite a bit and I find it pretty helpful when I'm struggling to identify my feelings.",
    "Personally I don't find it helpful because, generally speaking, expressing my emotions isn't really an issue for me. It's managing them that I am useless at",
    "I have it printed on a throw pillow in my office and clients use it frequently to identify feelings.",
    "I actually did. I thought it was hokey at first but then I read a lot of it and realized I learned from it. I didn\u2019t have a big feelings vocabulary or word bank available to me before.",
    "I feel mixed about it.\n\nI participated in a very intense therapy where you could only use the words angry, sad, scared or happy to describe emotions.  So when my new therapist showed me this, I was really grateful for the freedom to really get specific about how I was feeling.\n\nPast that, I don't really need it.  I have no issue identifying my emotions in most cases.",
    "I used something similar to this that only had two levels, was displayed as a list, and you were allowed to choose multiple things. I found that EXTREMELY helpful. But TBH this looks overwhelming so I can see why it might not be working out for you.\n\nEdit: also some of the third levels here just don't make sense. Ex: \"tired\" does not = \"unfocused\" or \"sleepy\" with no other words available (there's also exhausted, drained, apathetic, etc.) And you can feel unfocused without feeling tired, they don't really go together for me personally. IMO this wheel specifically kind of sucks lmao",
    "It\u2019s very helpful. Once I build the vocabulary for my emotions I can learn to accept them and normalize them. \u201cName it to tame it\u201d",
    "I hate that the \"happy\" category is as small as it is",
    "How does it work? Like, if I feel \"bored,\" it's neither of those two. It's... Unfulfilled and Anxious to feel Excited?",
    "Weirdly, I'm getting a pillow with this on it for myself and my family. I used to write a lot and I used thesauruses and never really had any trouble identifying feelings via that way, but in therapy I have trouble identifying anything other than the basic feelings in the middle. \n\nI'm not sure why it matters to my therapist, but it does.",
    "It really helped me see how the feelings are related. I really struggle with anger and it helped me realize that yeah. I'm angry, just not in the way I expected. It's also kinda nice when I'm stuck and can't identify what's wrong. \n\nIt's definitely not 100% accurate tho, I even had a few T's tell me that. Don't think that just because it's written and structured a certain way, that it's always the case. You can have emotions in the inner wheel but dont match the outside wheel. It's literally meant to be a starting point (Ive only ever seen it used that way, but it could depend on the T) where you can pick an emotion you can relate to and start to dig.",
    "I like it. For me, I have either an overwhelming amount of feelings or no feeling at all so it\u2019s helpful to identify what exactly I\u2019m feeling. Identifying feelings helps others know where you are at and start to help you.",
    "I love it.",
    "For those who have difficulty identifying what they feel for any number of reasons it can be an excellent first step to breaking that wall. It's also a good teaching tool for small kids starting out on the \"managing their big feelings\" journey.\n\nFor others it's not the right tool and that's okay. If it doesn't work for you it's fine to let your T know and move on to something else. I usually give a recommended tool/technique a good try to get a good feel for it and make sure I'm using it appropriately, then I can decide whether to keep it in my \"toolkit\" or move on without it.",
    "I\u2019m stealing my this for my 11 year old, who defaults to \u201cangry\u201d when he\u2019s feeling embarrassed or guilty or mistreated. This is a great way to get him to identify his actual feelings.",
    "I\u2019m autistic, so identifying my emotions has always been difficult. The wheel made things a bit easier, but once I grasped the concept of the wheel and it\u2019s tiers, it almost felt too limited? Like, my T would get confused/try to redirect entirely when id use a feeling not under the wheel but under one of the subsequent categories. Good to start off with but I wish it was more broad sometimes",
    "Off topic, but I find it great for writing. Other than that, it is ok.",
    "I question the accuracy of some of them. Take for example \u201cnumb\u201d being a branch of anger. For me, \u201cnumb\u201d is also a branch of \u201csad.\u201d I also question jealousy not being a branch of fearful, though I would revoke that if they added \u201cenvy\u201d somewhere on there.\n\nThat said, in some ways it is very helpful. It does allow me to realize that many emotions are intricate and boil down to deep-rooted, more discrete feelings.",
    "I love the feelings wheel!!! I drew my own because it felt so impactful. An important piece is missing here, the division and labels of \"needs are met\" and \"needs are not being met\". That has helped me frame a reasoning for my feelings.\n\nETA: upon further review I don't like this particular wheel. When it's laid out symmetrically you also get an indication of \"opposites\".",
    "It's a case by case thing for me\n\nWhen it comes to trauma, I'm particularly careful. I prefer expressions of emotions where, say, adjectives are included, rather than a wheel, which excludes  ambivalence. Also, in the beginning of a healing process or when a deeper layer is discovered, an emotion or a group of simultaneous ones can be too difficult to process right away. This happens especially if the emotion(s) are intertwined with past abusive reactions from caretakers, an overwhelming natural disaster, a newly diagnosed chronic physical illness or when an emotion is particularly intense. In order for a person to survive difficult situations, emotions can also be repressed or cut off so powerfully that numbness or an empty space is perceived or the emotion is only present in the constant trembling of one hand, tense back muscles etc. Emotions can also be completely obscured by other, seemingly irrelevant emotions or behaviours - or even needs, which would not be there without the trauma. \n\nIn these cases I'd be really careful with introducing emotions before a client is ready to make their emotions their own. Someone who has had an severely authoritarian upbringing, may say they feel what they think the therapist expects rather than what they're actually feeling. \n\nSome examples of emotions with adjectives: *Trigger warning just incase* \n\nUnmovable helplessness, powerless anger, nameless fear, hateful anxiety, hungry guilt, lonely hope etc. \n\nSometimes authentic adjectives may seem arbitrary and hard to understand, but that only happens before the necessary connection is uncovered",
    "I\u2019m autistic and have a lot of trouble navigating my emotions so this wheel helps me a lot. I can\u2019t always start at the middle and pick it out but if I go down the ones that might apply eventually I get to something that makes sense for how I\u2019m feelingx",
    "People don't have enough words. Mostly they say, I'm fine.",
    "I wanted to pick overwhelmed on that wheel, and it took me about 5 minutes to find it...",
    "Happy Peaceful Powerful Sad Angry Scared. Anything else is either a version of one of these, or a blend of them. They are like the primary colors. Frankly, anything more than this is probably too complicated\u2014the exception being someone who wants to learn more \u201cfeeling words\u201d in order to help them discuss their feelings. But most people still need to learn about the basic six. Keeping it to six really helps figure out what you are feeling. The underlying theory is that the emotions are part of the sensorium. And if you are healthy, they motivate you to get your needs met in an appropriate way. Fear lets you know that there is a danger and to \u2018fight or flee.\u2019 Sadness lets you know that you have experienced a loss, and that you need to replace (recathect) something. Anger lets you know that there is something unfair in your environment and motivates you to seek justice. Further, neurotic symptoms can be understood as using an inappropriate emotion to avoid feeling the appropriate one. One example would be acting angry to avoid feeling grief (i.e., sadness).",
    "Hard no. I think that grouping some of these emotions as forms of other emotions is flawed at best and potentially confusing. Like I'd spend more time arguing about whether creative can be considered at all related to powerful and whether powerful is connected to happy etc than I would talking about anything useful.",
    "I found it very helpful. I discovered for me that there is magic in naming what I was feeling. Before this, I only had two names for feelings\u2014crappy and OK. I discovered that my feelings were almost always connected to thoughts, like two sides to a coin. I learned how to relate my feelings and thoughts to my needs and values. I was able to stop the head spinning, constant rinse cycle going on in my head. I found this wheel to be magic.",
    "I personally have not; it's never been about not having the \\*words\\* for me so much as having someone point out when I'm feeling something and asking me to slow down and explore it. People have shoved the wheel at me before but it's like asking me to tell what I'm tasting in a fire hose.",
    "I\u2019m a therapist and I use this exact image sometimes for people who really struggle to identify more than a couple of emotions. I don\u2019t like this wheel because \u201cbad\u201d isn\u2019t an emotion, and some of the related emotions are confusing, hard to follow the creator\u2019s logic. I\u2019m not sure who made this but I doubt it was made based on our current understanding of emotions from a science/research perspective. I use this and a grid I found made for writers to help expand their emotional vocabulary. When I use these tools it\u2019s just to help expand and create nuance in emotional understanding and expression.\n\nIt has utility in some situations but lacks in lots of areas. \n\nPersonally, I showed this to my husband to joke about \u201cbad\u201d but he actually saved it in his phone and uses it sometimes.",

    "I, as a therapist and as a patient, love it. \nI find that we get stuck in using the same words to describe our feelings, and really looking into what your emotion is and identifying it can have a huge difference in how you experience it. \nAnother use is for people who have been taught that feeling feelings is bad, and have difficulty identifying their feelings, recognizing that they\u2019re feeling something  and stuff like that.",

The hierarchies are somewhat related but I don't really focus on them.

    "I find it odd that it\u2019s called a \u2018feelings\u2019 wheel since feelings are the bodily sensations that arise, such as tighness in the chest or butterflies in the stomach. Whereas it would be better described as an emotions wheel - working from the coarse centre and refining outwards, and then sense the associated bodily sensations.\n\nI saw a great picture a couple of days ago which had a bunch of bunched up colors representing emotions on the left, and on the right it had them neatly lined up in a grid - that\u2019s how I see the wheel being useful in unscrambling our emotional soup we live in",
    "I'm with you here. It totally made me feel like I was being treated like a child when my therapist first brought it up. But then, I realized that's kind of the point - I didn't get the parenting growing up that taught me how to identify my feelings so that's what we're doing now. \n\nMy feelings vocabulary was like four words...lol. I found the feelings wheel really helpful in drilling down into more specific emotions.",
    "Yeah I feel like this is what has me struggling cuz I\u2019d feel like they are misplaced, like worthless should b under sad.. I could b wrong. Maybe I\u2019m not understanding fear and that\u2019s y I think that. Or I can\u2019t find the word. So I choose a few and I guess it\u2019s cause more confusion for me.",
    "Would love to see your version.",
    "Wow. Great response and thank you.",
    ">\u201cbad\u201d isn\u2019t an emotion\n\n...why not? (not trying to be snarky, I genuinely want to know your answer!)",
    "\"I feel bad\" is often my starting point (even before/without the wheel) and the words they use there help to break down what those feeling might actually be are generally descriptive of what I'm experiencing. \n\nTo me, it's kind of like that feeling as you're just starting to get sick: you know you feel off, you feel bad, but it's more of a general malaise than a specific symptom or feeling. From a colloquial linguistic perspective and for people who may have limited interoception or other complications, this makes perfect sense. (It's also really helpful for kids. I do think a \"I feel good\" section would be a useful counterpoint though)\n\n(I'm autistic. To me, feelings don't have to be specific limited emotions (\"I feel tired\" is a feeling, but not an emotion, though often it overrides any others), and they aren't necessarily accompanied by the thoughts of those emotions. Neutral is also an option we aren't given enough)",
    "This one makes more sense to me but maybe I'm not understanding the professional looking one.",
    "I got a pillow covers with it on it off Amazon! Then bought a throw pillow insert for it! I love it! I use it often for myself and show my 3yr old it, she likes the colors! I hope to use it for her to explain her own feelings",
    "Mine too! He asked me if I want ed to use it ans rolled my eyes lol- that man gets so much grief from me haha",
    "then maybe it\u2019s not the right tool for you :) \n\nin my experience, it\u2019s difficult for me to really describe or tell other people how im feeling, so i will use baseline general emotional states to describe EVERYTHING. it can be difficult for others to understand me and my needs, and it\u2019s difficult for myself to do so as well because i don\u2019t have the language to describe little specific emotions (how i would describe the outer circle, not saying they are \u201csmall\u201d emotions). when i can understand the driving force, \u201creal emotion\u201d, or trigger to my BIGGER emotions (inner circle), i feel like i have a much richer understanding of how to manage, express, or simply identify what im going through. \n\nif you can already identify these in yourself, that may mean you\u2019re at a different point or require different tools in your therapy sessions, bring this up to your therapist and they may have other options for you, i don\u2019t know what you\u2019re in therapy for but if things aren\u2019t working or seem repetitive without progress, let your therapist know! \n\nhope this helped in some way :)",
    "Yeah, I think you\u2019re right that it is confusing. My initial response to your post was going to be that I do find it helpful, because \u201chow do you feel\u201d is always a much easier question for me when it\u2019s multiple choice. But in truth I think just having a list of emotions is just as good if not better than the wheel.\n\nEdit: Also I think this is a particularly bad wheel. I think there are ones with just two levels that are a lot less confusing/inaccurate.",
    "Yes it's confusing. I used to just sit and study this one for long time and still could not get it. Then one day got the idea to search for 'feelings wheel for kids'. It's a basic one and the only one I feel comfortable to work with. Somehow I have gotten better at identifying my feelings. From \"I'm not sure\", now after thinking about it for minutes, I'm able to name the feeling. So it did help me somehow.",
    "Yeah - don't take that element too seriously - it's really just a prompt with a lot of words to help you pin down what you're feeling with more specificity. There's nothing scientific about the categories.",
    "I\u2019m create when I\u2019m angry and sad more than when I\u2019m happy. I use them as single items too and may look at the hierarchy to see if I\u2019m feeling anything else. Actually what I found really helpful was looking at the emotions that are written on a scale from mild to severe. It really helps me to use the right word.",
    "I don't think the things can ONLY be in the places they are set on the wheel, it's more like a suggestion of where they might fit so that people who have no idea can start to narrow it down. If you know that a feeling is different to how the wheel places it then you can go ahead and express that without using the wheel.",
    "It also doesn't clear up things like anger being secondary to fear.",
    "https://www.gottman.com/blog/printable-feeling-wheel/\n\nThis looks similar to the one I was thinking of. I like the use of joyful rather than happy, and powerful is a great opposite for angry (powerless).",
    "\u201cGood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d are emotional valences, not specific emotions. I don\u2019t mean that citing a valence isn\u2019t useful, it just doesn\u2019t fit into the layout of this wheel. If bad is there, where is good?\n\nRegardless of what other commenters have said about this I\u2019m not going to chastise a client for saying \u201cI feel bad\u201d or \u201cthis is how I feel,\u201d I go with what the client says. If I\u2019m using this wheel, the goal is to go from a general feeling to a more specific feeling if the client wants to develop a better understanding of their emotional experiences and improve emotional communication.",
    "These are all constructs we use to describe biological processes combined with social contexts. I hate when people tell me this or that are not emotions/feelings. If I lifted up a piece of paper and said \"this is how I feel\" and riped it in a bunch of peices id say you might know what I mean. If I also followed it up with context it would make even more sense. Learning words to comunicate is helpful but not the end all be all of communication/emotion. Some cultures even have words to describe emotions we dont have, or that we need (assuming you speak english) to use sentances to describe.\n\nTherapists can do much better at being empathetic instead of saying \"you are wrong use the words I say to use\".",
    "I find it helpful to connect it to a recent event or something im doing. At any given moment we are all feeling a lot of different things all at once depending on what is going on. Saying \"how are you feeling\" is really hard to answer. Like, how do I feel about you asking that question of me? Or how ive been feeling in general? How long in general? Like the last 5 minutes? The whole week? About what is happening in the future? Asking me how I feel in any moment is near impossible to say so most people just say \"good\" because it is a catch all. Give me a specific moment in time with a context and I can tell you how I feel about it way better than a general abstract question like \"how do you feel\".\n\nIm eating food right now typing this, id say im feeling content and happy, my mouth feels buttery, I feel warm and joyful. Connecting things to an outside expierence is a little easier in my opinion. Emotions change quickly depending on what you are thinking about and where you are.",
    "Omg, can you link? I want this!",
    "Thanks! I still really don't understand how it's meant to work. For example, a lot of the outer emotions here don't appear to be actually linked to the inner emotions - they're not more specific expressions of the inner one, they're different emotions entirely, or even linked to a different inner emotion. If anything I would have thought it worked in the opposite way... you feel vaguely sad so you pick a type of sad you think is near what you're feeling. But again I don't really understand how naming it is meant to help. It doesn't change what the feeling is. \n\nI actually left therapy because it didn't help me. Therapy entirely was not the right tool for me :)",
    "I didn\u2019t know that either",
    "Oooh yeah, that\u2019s the good one.",
    "Exactly. \"X is not an emotion\".... that's not helpful. These are words I'm using to attempt to communicate my experience, and if you don't get it, well, I'm sorry. I'm using those words or those examples because the ones you'd prefer I use are not adequate.",

I ended up deleting that account and leaving that T, but I went back recently for a couple of proper termination sessions. It is still kinda sad to not be her client anymore, but it feels good to have said what I wasn\u2019t able to at the time and to get some closure, and she was really great about it all and I\u2019m finally feeling less ashamed of the maternal transference I was experiencing.\n\nI do really appreciate all the help she gave me and so I made this for her. I thought you\u2019d enjoy it. Source is a SrGrafo image that I edited to give it a therapy twist. Thanks for all the support during that difficult time!",

What makes me different? (The answer is always that I\u2019m a bad person and then we get into the \u201cwhy are you bad?\u201d cycle...she\u2019s got to be so sick of my shit by now. No wonder she\u2019s retiring hahaha)\n\nUgh. It\u2019s so hard sometimes.",
    "Agreed! The original meme fits with the therapy metaphor perfectly :)",

    "[deleted]",
    "Thank you for this! When I first told my therapist about wishing she were my mom in a long and terrified email, part of what I voiced being upset about was the fact that she was \u201cjust my therapist.\u201d At our next session she said, \u201cyes I am your therapist and you are my client, but I am also a caring human being and I really care about you too.\u201d I carry that with me all the time for comfort. \n\nJust a few weeks ago I told her that I still sometimes get into a shame spiral about my attachment to her. Later that evening she emailed me a Buddhist meditation she said made her think of me about how nothing that we feel in our hearts with tenderness and kindness should bring us shame, but should instead we should be warm toward the feelings and just feel what we feel. \n\nYour post is another good reminder of it all! My therapist is so warm, caring, brilliant, funny, etc, so when I was deprived of that sort of connection in my formative years of course I crave it all the time now that I have it.",
    "You just put into words something I\u2019ve felt for a long time but could never articulate. It\u2019s completely natural and kind of unavoidable for an attachment to happen after months or years sharing with someone. I admitted to my therapist that she is one of the most important people in my life (top four for sure) I was terrified to disclose this and admit how strong my attachment is but she was completely understanding and reassuring that it\u2019s a normal things for people in long term therapy. No one else in my life knows more about me than her. No one else in my life has helped me through so many traumatic events, events other people in my life don\u2019t even know happened because they are centered around addictions which I keep secret. She is open to me texting her when something goes wrong. I have an on call therapist how amazing is that. I had a break up and not five minutes later she is texting with me helping me through it. I was 5150ed and as soon as she found out she called the hospital to check on me during probably one of the worst experiences of my life. It isn\u2019t weird that she is one of the most important people in my life after all we have been through what would be weird is if she wasn\u2019t.",
    "Hear, hear!",

    "Damn, thank you. This was well timed and I needed to hear it. I\u2019ve been feeling kinda stupid for getting attached since it\u2019s got an expiration date and I\u2019ve got a bunch of feelings and feel like that\u2019s annoying and dependent, especially because I don\u2019t have much support outside of therapy. Guess I can tell where these thought processes came from in my life, though.\n\nI know what I\u2019m gonna be trying to admit tomorrow in therapy, oof.",
    "Yes, therapists are human! To take this in a bit of a different direction, for the most part, they are not gods, not angels, not superheroes. They are human!\n\n\nSo I agree with the OP that it\u2019s totally normal to feel intensely for your therapist in weird and wonderful ways. But I also always try and stress here that therapists don\u2019t have all the answers. They\u2019re not perfect. They don\u2019t spend all day and night analyzing every micro interaction with clients. \n\n\nMost therapists have very little training on transference and counter-transference. So while this sub is pretty obsessed with transference/attachment, your therapist may not actually know how to skillfully navigate those waters. Next time you see your therapist, you can ask them straight up what they know about different types of attachment and theoretically sound practices for working with attachment issues. Also, most therapists receive little to no supervision once they finish school so they may not recognize or know what to do with their own counter-transference. They may act in very *human* (i.e., faulty) ways towards you that go against the *idealized therapist* trope. \n\n\nSome people here are blessed with wonderfully caring, well-trained therapists who are not super burnt out but many are not so lucky. So please, as much as you can, be vigilant in your own care and mental health/illness journey. Educate yourself and stand up for your rights as a client. \n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f",
    "Thanks, I needed to hear this today <3  \n\n\nI'm in the midst of painful maternal transference, and I often struggle with letting myself feel healed by the transference and thinking it's stupid/wrong.\n\nAs much as we as patients might feel very bonded to our therapists, I guess it's also helpful to remember we matter to them too. In a different way albeit, but the attachment and care is still there. I think you're right in that it would be hard to experience a relationship with as much emotional closeness as the one in therapy without a bond forming.",
    "unfortunately i keep paying a therapist that doesn\u2019t do shit for me. I recently saw a post here where someone was asking what\u2019s the best advice your therapist has ever given you and you know what that is in my case? Nothing. Just, nothing. I got very attached to my therapist, but i think she kind of fucks with my feelings. She called me childish when i was suicidal, she laughed when i started talking about my fantasies, she had a pretty unprofessional response to self-disclosure. So why do i keep paying her? Well, i guess i depend on her too much. She hurts me, but i still want to see and talk to her. \n\nSo i think many clients know that transference is normal, but i don\u2019t think they are treated like they should be by their therapist. And i think this is when we feel guilty for having these feelings. I personally am very insecure right now. I\u2019m starting to hate myself for feeling like this.",

    "Therapist here. Thank you for such a lovely post. It truly warmed my heart. I own a private practice and have been a therapist for 25+ years. The last 16 months has been HARD. I love my job. I do. I care deeply for many of the individuals I have the privilege to work with and for. Do I need to know what in the hell I am doing as a therapist? Yes. But more importantly, do I have chemistry and can build a therapeutic alliance with this individual? My ability to BE IN relationship with my patients is what drives my passion and commitment to make a difference in others lives and leave this world a better place when I am gone. I have VERY clear boundaries with patients. We need them so that the environment can be fully safe and healthy. I also use my relationship with them as a tool in so many powerful and healing ways (if appropriate to what they are seeking treatment for). It is truly an honor and a privilege to be allowed into someone\u2019s most intimate and private parts of their life. It is a responsibility that I take very seriously. I am humbled by each and every person who has the courage to choose to come to therapy, and they are paying me a shit-ton of money to help them get better so I want to give excellent quality of care. I am so grateful for the patients who can see my humanity. Sometimes we have patients that treat us like shit, I kid you not. But I stay in the trenches if I know there is a purpose to the battle. (I will fire their ass if they are repeatedly shitty). The last 16 months has been a battle. I have worked more hours than I want to admit. Our community is swamped with need and I am already almost booked through this next December. While I was worried about how the fuck I was going to keep my own business going/stay safe/protect my family/pay my bills with the shutdown\u2026 I needed to be there for my patients. I was NOT going to stop seeing my people, no matter what. I have been exhausted, yet joyful and grateful every day. Thank you to each and every one of you who chooses to trust us with your mind and heart. I speak for many when I humbly say, \u201cTHANK YOU.\u201d",
    "An interesting story to add \u2026 I remember years ago when I was buying my home. An excellent realtor came to me via a friend\u2019s referral. During the buying process, my realtor and I called and emailed and texted, day and night, for a couple of months. \n\nI found myself becoming \u201cobsessed\u201d with her. I thought about her a lot in non real estate-related contexts (e.g., I\u2019d be out shopping and say, \u201cOoo, I\u2019ll bet Susie would LOVE this dress!\u201d). I liked her so much. I wondered if I LIKE-liked her (We\u2019re both straight and she\u2019s married). \n\nIt was quite hard when the sale went through and we were no longer in regular touch. I remember trying to continue the regular texting and inviting her over to \u201csee the new place furnished!\u201d She artfully declined.\n\nI eventually forgot about her.\n\nSome distance (plus this thread) has helped me see \u2014 I might not have received kind, competent attention in my early life. It is human to want that. When I experience it \u2014 I love it! I want more of it!\n\nNow that I have this insight, I can give myself a break when I feel I\u2019m becoming \u201cobsessed\u201d with someone (like my T) and talk it through with my little parts. \u2764\ufe0f \n\nThanks again, OP.",
    "Thank you for sharing this... I feel conflicted sometimes about the money, or the fact that I can only talk to them \u201cin session\u201d, and that is such a small part of my 2 week cycle (I have two therapists that alternate weeks). And in a \u201creal relationship\u201d I would spend way more than 1 hour per week talking to them. So that part does feel artificial. Because I have to work up those feelings, and then separation anxiety for two weeks and then happy for an hour, rinse and repeat. I\u2019m really not happy with how it works, but I guess it does...",

    "I\u2019m so glad you said this. Transference/counter transference is so over thought.",
    "Well now....whoa there a second hoss.\n\nThere's a big difference between a human connection and transference.\n\nYou're correct that when you're in a long-term relationship with a T, and that T is the one person who knows and can comfortably discuss all the aspects of your life, there is going to develop a level of intimacy between you.\n\nBut the role of the therapist is what's known as the \"intimate stranger\"...the term was originally applied to teachers, but it's the same thing here.\n\nBecause the people who help you in this world MUST remain strangers to you. The teacher has multiple classes, and with each passing year, a new class takes their place. Your therapist has multiple clients. They are duty bound to treat everyone equally, no matter how much they may happen to \"like\" or \"dislike\" this one or or that one. THAT's the \"stranger\" part of the equation.\n\nAnd at a certain point, you're going to get better (at least, that's the plan), and move on so they can help someone else more in need.\n\nSo intimacy? Sure. Natural. There may even be genuine affection. There usually is.\n\nBut they have a RESPONSIBILITY TO YOU to keep a measure of distance, even if they honestly like you, maybe more than another client.\n\nIf the \"stranger\" role breaks down that makes it very difficult for them to help you. Because they're naturally going to seek to protect you from pain, rather than help you confront and navigate through pain. They've got to push you into places you don't want to go, and you've got to expect that they're the person who will do it...but also get you through to the other side.\n\nTransference actually has nothing to do with genuine affection. It's a con your mind plays on you to direct your thoughts OUTWARD instead of INWARD. The problem is....the only way you get better is to keep the focus inward. All outward looking is just misdirection. Even if it FEELS like you love/lust after your therapist, what's REALLY going on is just your mind trying to distract you from the painful stuff.\n\nSo weird? No. Shameful? No. Typical and expected? You betcha.\n\nBut finally....an impediment to actually making progress? Bingo.\n\nSo they're going to have to help guide you past it and back to yourself. Truth is, if you feel weird or ashamed....that's THEM not doing their job, not your fault. Your only responsibility is to show up.\n\nSo it's their DUTY to keep a certain distance, and to help you deal with all the misdirections. It's IN YOUR BEST INTEREST to recognize the misdirections for what they are. \n\nY'all gotta remember: the goal is to make it so you like YOURSELF best. Even better than you like them. And if they do their job right, that's where you're going to end up.",
    "True. Remember though at the end of the day it's your money. If you want to see someone else do it. This isn't a normal relationship. It's not \"cheating\" to seek out a better one. It'd be nice to give them some closure but remember you pay for this so don't feel to bad.\n\nThe world is full of troubled people when you leave someone else will foot the bill.\n\nThey are nice helpful people DOING A JOB. Enjoy your time but don't worry about seeking someone new if you want to.",

This post highlights that well I think and something I talk about with colleagues so often is that there are so many different approaches to therapy, so many different types of needs, so many ways to support, respond, and grow. Therapists cannot expect the general public to know how to navigate this and it is our responsibility to know how biases and transference is affecting the therapeutic relationship and to maintain a level of boundaries in order for the relationships to show up in people\u2019s lives where therapists no longer are filling that role. And, when I\u2019m looking for a therapist I try to find out about their orientations, how their experience relates to my goals and general preferences to be able to have that kind of communication and clarity. There\u2019s a survey that can be sooo helpful to formulate this conversation called the C-NIP which is free for all ;)",

And I have to acknowledge that when I write things about therapy, I'm making a lot of assumptions about the decency and goodness of the therapist themselves, and that just simply isn't always true.

He also said that transference could be a form of resistance but was oftentimes the very thing that made therapeutic progress possible.",

How on earth can our very nature as social animals be a con that prevents us from healing? It is exactly where healing can happen.\n\nHaving a therapist who acknowledges their own feelings (within the boundaries of therapy) in return? That's where the magic happens. \n\nHaving a therapist who denies the existence of the relationship or insists that feelings are distraction/defenses is going to do a lot more harm than good.

I described it as like a very young kid hiding behind their parents legs while the grown ups talk until they warm up and feel more comfortable in the situation.

Even reframing as a see you later its still gut wrenching. We know absolute minimum for her absence is 3 months could be 6 months could be longer. We won't know until she begins treatment and sees how she deals with it all.

While we all deserve mother figures in our lives, a big piece of my personal healing g has been with a therapist who helped model healthy mothering but also empowered me to realize I can do this for myself, and anything on top of that is a beautiful bonus. What do you feel like your goal might be with the next T as you transition the lessons from your previous one? You don\u2019t have to answer, but of course you can.",
    "Good for you for writing down all the distinct ways she\u2019s helped you / you\u2019ll miss her. For me, the attachment stuff can feel so impossible bc it all feels fuzzy and overwhelming. As difficult as this is, I want to share how helpful you\u2019re being to yourself by clearly expressing it. \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019ll bet your lovely T helped you learn how to articulate your feelings. \u2764\ufe0f",

I'm hoping the transference stuff doesn't carry over cause Jesus its been painful and I'm really not keen on repeating all of that \n\nMy goals with the new T look different because myself and both Ts are going in with the knowledge that this is a temporary relationship born of necessity. Since my T is going away, and since I have a large amount of feelings both about her absence, her illness and the open ended nature of her absence, this gives me a safe space to talk about all that, without the inherent difficulties of telling my T all about how them being sick is affecting me. At this stage all I know for sure is she is intending to come back but that I'm looking at minimum 3-6 months before that happens. As you can imagine, and as I've talked about fairly frequently in the last month and a half this has been extremely painful \n\nMy goals with this new T look like continuing some of the work I've done with my T although in different ways, and  hopefully being able to carry the sense of safety and security my T has created for me in the last nearly 3 years into the new relationship for however long it may last",

    "Well actually I wasn\u2019t intending to bring it up because I was too nervous to talk about it! But towards the end of quite a heavy session he asked me if I was suicidal and so I took my chance! If he hadn\u2019t said that, I probably wouldn\u2019t have gone into detail in honesty",
    "yeah he\u2019s awesome! Thank you so much \ud83e\udd70",
    "Absolutely willing to share thank you for asking! And congrats on disclosing it in the first place, that\u2019s a huge step in itself \ud83d\udc95 I think what really put me at ease was that he totally validated the experience, he said considering what I\u2019m going through at the moment it actually makes a lot of sense to be feeling this way, and just hearing that alone was really helpful to me. He also asked me questions that I hadn\u2019t asked myself - things like do you feel safe? How do you feel when these thoughts come up? Do you notice the thoughts come up at any particular time? We worked through some of my answers to those questions, and also some things I could maybe do when the thoughts come up which made me feel like I had a bit more of a grasp on the situation, rather than feeling totally out of my mind and not knowing what to do with all these thoughts. I totally understand that it\u2019s scary bringing this topic up (hence why I also only said it right at the end but then he uno reversed me and stayed lmao) but I hope you\u2019re able to also talk through how you\u2019re feeling and have a validating experience too, you deserve it \u2764\ufe0f",
    "Right! I feel very lucky. This gesture meant the world to me as well, especially as like you I\u2019m his last client of the day so I bet he can\u2019t wait to be done most of the time! Thank you, wishing you well too!",
    "It\u2019s a pretty common practice to extend sessions or increase contact with clients during moments of crisis or when they have feelings of suicide. It doesn\u2019t sound like he crossed a boundary to me. It seemed like it was impactful and that is great to hear!\n\nEdit: Well perhaps it is crossing a boundary by extending sessions, but it's not unethical and it's a therapeutic boundary crossing I think.",
    "My therapist also does phone consults between sessions! It helps especially if she doesn\u2019t have an available slot at the last minute. I would sometimes apologize to her as I don\u2019t want to bother her with my problems when she\u2019s done for the day or on weekends but I always make sure to ask if she has time to talk as a sign of respect for her time and space.",
    "That's a different thing though? And also it's a mixed bag for sure. But I've been reading along for a few years now and the amount of time people got warned about boundaries is excessive.\n\nI think we should only warn about boundaries when a therapist is obviously crossing them. But when clients push on the boundaries, it's between that therapist and the client and not some subreddit that only hears half the story.\n\nSure we can give advice based on what seems to be commonly accepted but every therapist and modality and client is different.",
    ">I find this sub very weird in its expectation that therapists should validate everything clients ever think, say, or do.\n\nI find the opposite. I see stories every day of therapist inappropriateness with blatant dismissals. I see and agree with your side of the argument, but please be aware that there's also a major issue with the pendulum going the other way. And maybe part (not all, but part) of what you are calling \"weird\" is a response to that.",
    "Yes. The simplest way to explain it is this. How would you feel about your Therapist if you had a major thing going on in your life and you had to wait In the lobby for an extra 45 minutes? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
    ">I would sometimes apologize\n\nI call him and when he answers I identify myself as his \"needy client\" calling him again. And he reassures me that if he doesn't have time or if he can't take my call he won't and will call me back when he has time. Whenever I express shame about needing extra support, he asks me how his reaction is, as in...\"I'm happy to give you extra support. No need to apologize.\"",

    "That's really sweet from him \ud83e\udd72",
    "I hear you on all the issues you describe and I agree with you actually. Though there are also quite a few people who when they can find the energy (myself included) try to shine some light on that. But yes, this is a place with people with a whole lot of intense feelings and desires.\n\nHowever, my point stands. Whenever someone asks about giving a present, emailing the therapist, asking for an extra session, asking for a phone call etc it's like 'boundaries!'. And that's my point, clients needn't worry about that. The T can deal with that. \n\nBut the sub has grown a lot the last year or so, doubled maybe even tripled. So yeah, I maybe still see things how they were when it was only 10k people and not that many posts.\n\nedit: I do want to add, when I just started coming here, as someone who doesn't have these intense attachment issues (instead it took me over 2yrs to feel any attachment at all), I was harsh on the people who did, the way you seem to be (though I didn't say it out loud much). Visiting this sub and reading the stories has taught me to not judge it as strongly and to realise everybody goes through their own struggles and process and awareness.",
    "I agree with you except that I think some therapists actually aren't able to manage their own boundaries which is maybe why it gets called out on here. And also sometimes those boundaries are complicated and what feels okay for the therapist is harmful for the client which is what happened to me (it's a long story) and might be why people are hesitant sometimes.",
    "I think the complicated thing is, the people who visit here in majority are those with intense attachment feelings and they struggle. So they come here and talk about how hard it is, that they wish they somehow got more from their T. So then when someone else posts who 'gets more', they see only how they'd want that. It's like any echo chamber basically. \n\nI have noticed more therapists on the sub lately, so I hope they can help with some of that too. And it's good you're also looking out for people!",
    "Yeah that makes sense. I'm actually one of those people with intense attachment. But I learned that I need boundaries at the same time because what I want and what I need are different things. That's why I say that some therapists may not realize that drastically loosening their boundaries might feel fine for them, but it's not helpful to the client. That's not to say the above post is like that though. But I just think some therapists (not all) are not capable of managing their boundaries effectively.",

    "I love this. So much. I want everyone to have a scale. This would be so helpful in just every-day going abouts... as someone who has failed to properly portray my emotions frequently, this would just be so helpful. What a good idea!",

    "It's really great! Love it! For me, getting over that feeling of inadequaecy and anxiety when feeling judged by others is practically insurmountable.... sometimes. Other times, as soon as that self-defeating talk creeps up, I have to slooooooowwwwww dooooooowwwwwnnn tiiiiiiimeeee and get mindful, stop the thought, grab it gently, pet it like a little puppy and get all CURIOUS with it. That's what you do, you do not allow yourself a reaction, you give yourself SPACE, get that \"they think I'm ugly and poor\" (I dunno that's what I always think) and say, \"Why do you feel this way? Hey, YOU are not ugly and poor. Well, you are pretty poor, and one time a cow fainted when it turned around and saw you, but it's okay. This person? They are just another person, and you are writing a narrative that they think you are ugly and poor.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe comic just spoke to me so deeply, because I remember years ago being at that spot where every encounter filled me with fear and loss of safety and discomfort. I thought they were all looking at me. They would look at my teeth, or my fat, or my loose arm skin, shit, I dunno! But you do find peace in making space to get curious and gentle with your thoughts, and you can simply acknowledge the thoughts, and like Marie Kondo, wish the shitty thought well, and send it off into the ether. Try it! The next time a self-deprecating thought pops up and you are out in public and you are starting to feel a panic attack brewing, stop everything, take a moment to do your breathing and while you focus on your breath try to track down a couple of the negative thoughts that are driving your reaction to your environment. It's amazing how mindfulness CAN absolutely work wonders. How long has it taken me?\n\nI was in therapy LONG BEFORE I made this account.  It's a marathon, not a race, just keep moving, sometimes it's going to be extremely slow, sometimes you'll even move backwards, but just remember the only end of the race is you dying, so, try to move, Just move. <3",
    "Is this all he gave in response to you bringing up people's concerns?",
    "The artwork is really wonderful. I will say, however, that your therapist seems quite frustrating. He could do better than to ask you why you let yourself feel this way and then tell you to keep working on it (as if it's not his job to help you work on it).\n\nOne thing that's great about therapy is that you can give your therapist feedback on how they are doing and if something they're doing isn't working. I'm a therapist and I love when clients feel comfortable enough to to give me negative feedback.  Ask yourself if you feel comfortable enough to tell him. If you don't feel comfortable enough, shouldn't you be able to trust him that much? That's probably something he can work on too. Hope this helps and I hope you get the help you need!",

It's still a very abstract concept to me. \n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that he also brought up famous artists whose work was so controversial they were even imprisoned for their work and named some examples which I forget, and recommended (I'm not sure if he was being serious) that I draw and post the most controversial art I can come up with and read through all the hate and train myself to not let it faze me.",

Her T of 15+ years died of a heart attack and she found out from his wife who had posted a sign on the door telling clients to call her. My friend grieved. That's really the only thing you can do. Honor your own grief and find a way to honor the memory of your therapist. It helped my friend to be able to go to the public memorial service (not the private one) and to send condolences to his wife. My friend mentions him to me sometimes, and says she visualizes him looking down from heaven on her. Even if you don't believe in an afterlife, you'll carry your T's memory in your heart, and he'll live on in that way.",

She just had such a positive auora about her. I wish she knew how much she helped me feel a little less overwhelmed. I still think about her and hope her family is doing the best they can. Her kids are so young. \n\nI like the idea of writing a letter. I think that would bring comfort to his family knowing he was a positive light in many lives.",

It was devastating. All I can advise is, try to talk to someone else. Go with the first one who makes you feel like they hear you and care, even if they're not a perfect fit. You don't necessarily have to keep them, but you at least need to process this tremendous loss with someone.",

He meant just as much to me as my therapist does to me now. \nThe best advice I can give is to allow yourself to feel everything - people don\u2019t understand this type of loss so finding people who can support you and your grief is so important.",

Your therapist offering you free sessions indicated that he really cared about you and what you're going through. It sounds like you had a really meaningful therapeutic relationship. What a really difficult thing to experience. \n\nHe would be so proud of both you and himself to learn that you are driven to grieve, process, and seek help in such a healthy way. You really are preserving his memory through the lessons you have learned from him by approaching this with resilience. \n\nI hope to learn from you. \u2764 Thank you for posting, and I'm sorry he passed away.",

    "I am so sorry for your loss and for how hard it is to grieve on top of everything else that you were already experiencing and trying to work through. One of my previous therapists abruptly retired without any notice due to a medical diagnosis and during our unexpectedly last session together, the biggest thing we focused on was on how to keep moving forward with my recovery without getting consumed by the loss and what felt like abandonment. It is too easy to get pulled downwards and fall back into bad patterns when trying to deal with a devastating loss. Focusing on how to move forward and on what was next is the biggest thing that helped me to keep going, to keep pushing to get through the difficult emotions, and to accept that I had lost someone important to me, someone I had looked to for support. Obviously my experience is different than yours and I can only imagine what you are going through. \nThis may not make sense or something similar may have been said already but it might be worth trying to process your grief as if you were working through it with your therapist, instead of about your therapist - as if you were in one last session together. What do you think your therapist would say to you if they could - any final words of advice and encouragement, guidance for how to process and manage your grief, some self-guided EMDR exercises you could try maybe, anything like that? Try to remember all the advice that your therapist gave you and try to apply it to your current situation as much as you can. It might be both too soon and/or too painful to consider something like this but it might help you find some sort of closure or at the very least help you to move forward and to hopefully find another therapist to help you process your loss and to continue your recovery. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to feel the loss - and know that you will get through this. I am so sorry that this happened and that there is no easy solution for any of what you are going through. \nI hope this helped in some way and I am sorry if it did not.",
    "This happened to me although it occurred after one session but we had clicked well right off the bat.  I bursted out all my trauma right from the start, the first time in my life i have done this. I was in a good place feeling optimistic and then when I was on the road on vacation they call to tell me he died of a heart attack. They hooked me up with his practicing partner and that was pretty devastating. His partner was the complete opposite and set me back quite a ways. I\u2019m glad your therapist was able to help you in a positive way.  Maybe this will be a time of growth for you and hopefully you can find another therapist that can help guide you with a fresh perspective. And now you know of some things that were working so take his advice from your sessions and let his work carry on through you and his other patients. It\u2019s normal to have grief from this, just make sure to talk through your feelings and emotions and not let them marinate for too long inside your head. Good luck to you.",
    "How devastating and confusing. It sounds like he helped you a great deal and in my experience that means you had a real collaboration\u2014and it was probably very gratifying for your therapist.\n\nThere\u2019s a rather nice memoir called Your Voice in My Head about reflecting on a treatment after the death of a therapist (not by suicide) that I think gets at the importance of the relationship. Kind of records going through this very specific grief.",

I imagine he must have been struggling for a while. \n\n I haven\u2019t lost a therapist to suicide, but I have had a therapist very abruptly leave her practice when I\u2019d been working with her for about 6 years. I get the sense, from what you say, that he very much cared about you and did the extra work outside of normal sessions to make sure you got support. Take time to cry, remember the work you did with him, and talk with someone (friends, another therapist, etc.) about it. The work you and he did will still be here. Sending you virtual hugs and well wishes.",
    "Wow he sounds like he was an amazing person not just a therapist.\n\nSuicide is hard to deal with I had 2 friends that died. I actually found a meditation for suicide on YouTube that pretty much helps make you feel closure where you get to say your last goodbye. It was a guided meditation specifically for loss by suicide I think. It was very helpful.\n\nSorry to hear that though......dang. Glad you have a good supportive partner!",

You had an intimate relationship together and he gave you a lot of support. This loss is a shock. Please take all the time you need to grieve and process this. Get plenty of rest. This is a situation that will drain and take a lot out of you, so it's okay if you can't do anything as well as you normally can. Loss takes a significant toll on us.\n\nPlease take care of yourself. You will always have the memories you made with your T.",

I also logged on for an online session and he never showed. I thought I\u2019d gotten the week wrong because we did every-other-week sessions and I get mixed up. Then it happened again the next week and I thought it was a miscommunication about the holidays and timing. Then today I texted him, didn\u2019t here back and finally thought to check his website.\n\nI don\u2019t have any wisdom because I haven\u2019t even started processing it.

I know he would want me to continue moving forward and he would absolutely not want this event to pull me back. Figuring out how to continue when I am ready to will honor his memory more than anything else I can do. I also really like your idea of imagining a final session with him.

I told him embarrassing things I've never told anyone, not even other therapists before, and he always made sure I felt comfortable.

    "You are definitely not alone. Posting on reddit and finding comfort from people who understood the meaning of a relationship with a therapist was very helpful for me. It gave me a safe space to express how I was feeling and to talk about him and the impact he had on me. I gave myself all the  time and space I needed to feel the grief. The first while was very overwhelming and it was hard to put the grief down. I managed to focus the energy I did have on my self care. Eventually I'd have windows of time where it wouldn't feel so intense and the windows grew, but it's still there at times. Feeling gratitude for my T when I was ready to focus on it was also really helpful. It made the experience worth the pain because I'd rather have had to go through it to know him then not know him at all. I'm sorry you are feeling all of this too. I hope you find ways that work for you to process and comfort in the community here \ud83d\udc97",

Sex at appointments, have him homework about her, and began seeing each other out of office. True story, just pitching in because it\u2019s something that\u2019s prompted me to get myself into therapy myself \u2014 not to have an affair with one.. but to address all the deep seeded issues that have been around for so long. I would never come onto my therapist, but I\u2019ve also never experienced a situation either so passionate or so unprofessional that would have allowed it to even become a real thought in my mind. Just started therapy today and trying not to lose trust in the industry of therapy due to my pre-existing doubt even BEFORE my father\u2019s affair.\n\nEDIT: I want to add that I have no anger or judgement towards my father or even the therapist really who were involved\u2014 I just have always wondered how a therapist could see and care for their patients 24/7 in a genuine way and that makes me feel insecure about going to therapy.

That's okay, that's how it is, but there's still feelings.  \n\nI know my therapist cares for me a lot, and I care about her too, so sometimes it's hard that I can't reciprocate in the way I want to. Sometimes I feel like it's somehow incomplete? I don't know how to describe it.",

    "It's really kind of a mindfuck to read this subreddit  as a therapist some times. I've never had a client express these feelings to me before, though I have had at least one or two that I think did have some kind of romantic attachment to me (they terminated fairly quickly after I saw this possibility though we never spoke of it).\n\nI really don't get the sense that my clients are feeling this attached to me, but when I read here it can seem like every client is secretly in love with their therapist, even though I know this is not actually true.",

Luckily We do EMDR only so I don\u2019t have to tell her a lot.\n\nThis is a much more definitive example of actual transference, as opposed to the way many people tend to use it here as a catch-all term for any kind of attraction. Transference's definition is in its name: it happens when some kind of emotional association is *transferred* from a prior relational context into a new one where there's otherwise no logical reason for it being there. It has nothing to do in particular with falling in love or even just catching feels for someone.\n\nIf your therapist makes you feel uncomfortable because she reminds you both behaviorally and physically of your grandmother to the point where you're creating a direct association between them; and that's affecting your relationship with her to the point where you find yourself thinking that you're lucky that you \"don't have to tell her a lot\"... that's a textbook example of transference that's actively impairing the therapeutic relationship, and it's something that you might benefit from addressing with her if you feel comfortable.",

    "What the heck is FP?",
    "The type of client that visits a forum about therapy in their free time is probably more invested in their therapy than the average client, and that often comes with stronger attachment and feelings.",
    "While it likely does happen a lot more often than you'd suspect, it's also important to remember that this forum is far from an unbiased sample. Clients who experience these feelings are often distressed or confused by those feelings, and feel they have no one in whom they can safely confide, so they are driven to the safety of anonymous internet forums in hopes of finding others with the common experience.\n\nThat said, psychotherapy is a setting of positive regard and emotional intimacy. Doesn't it seem that it may actually be more surprising if a client *weren't* to experience some romantic impulse, even if it's fleeting? I feel desperately attached to my therapist but outwardly behave aloof if not even a little robotic. I can almost promise you my therapist hasn't much of a clue and would be shocked to know it. So you really never know.",
    "You said although no one has expressed feelings for you, you did suspect a few to have feelings\u2026 Im interested to know why you thought that? What were the things they did or said that made you believe they may have feelings?",
    "Don't they train therapists (I don't want to say \"warn\") this is something that can happen? Tell me you understand the reasons this can happen?",
    "Clearly not everyone experiences romantic feelings/transference in such a degree towards their T, but it does happen. Many clients create some form of attachment to the therapist, but the ones where it is so strong that it can be consuming all of your thoughts are in the minority. As others stated, people who feel these kind of emotions are ashamed and look for comfort, understanding, validation and simply just a way to deal with it. I would say more than 90% of the content on this sub is about transference and all the feelings that come with it so naturally it attracts clients who feel this way. \n\nI think this sub is a safe place mainly for internalizers to let their deepest thoughts and feelings out. Sometimes that includes things that a person can\u2019t say out loud, not even in the therapy room. Since many people on here experience more or less the same feelings towards their T, support and reassurance can be found. This encourages more other people to write about their feelings of transference causing this to be a hot topic. So I guess I would say that this sub is definitely biased and not a representation of the average client who goes to therapy. However, I still think that it is more common these days and that it should be more discussed in the therapy itself.",
    "I would imagine it happens so much more than you realize. I struggle so much with this with my therapist. I am f and he is m and we are close in age. I have tried to fight these \"fake\" feelings for months. It is not necessary romantic but I want him in my life, to love, care, and be with me. It is overwhelming constantly. I have felt like term with him so many times because it hurts so much.\nHe is an excellent therapist but my feelings towards him seem hurt me knowing it is all some contrived transference and it is not real.",

    "This was me. I started feeling some kinda way about my T and totally freaked out. Internet wasn't helping since I didn't know how to explain what I was feeling. I came here and got answers and I know others have been the same \n\nIt's the same as in like a relationship subreddit the most common advice is dumping the other partner. Cause happy couples usually don't post about it. Its a biased sample",
    "Two cases in which they asked me to hang out outside of the session. One case seemed to understand why I couldn\u2019t come to their art show (young adult) The other got very mad at me for telling them I could not go to their work place just to chat with them and hang out (teenager). \n\nI do also suspect that one adult male may have had a slight crush. That was more of an intangible feeling. He seemed to be too agreeable with me and said comments that were pushing the boundaries of the relationship and making  strong assumptions/predictions about my life. It never got in the way of deeper work but I started to get more and more of that feeling before he left.",
    "I\u2019ve posted about this before, but at least in my program and others I\u2019ve spoken about with some colleagues, it was an issue brought up very little. \u201cTraining\u201d was essentially non existent. With that said, the reasons make sense to a degree, but even with understanding why it can happen it can still be intense to see the reactions on here at times. Especially given that in now multiple years of doing this job, I\u2019ve never had a client directly address this with me.",
    "Thanks for the input. I definitely wish at least in my schooling it was talked about more. It really barely came up other than as a multiple choice question on some exams. Very little actual discussion around what it looks like and how to help process it. I think that\u2019s a major flaw in our current system.\n\nWith that said, while I do know it\u2019s not the majority, it is somewhat reassuring to read your response. I really hope that the majority of my clients either do not have intense romantic feelings for me (or should I say the idea of me) or if they did would be willing to share that in session with me. I certainly would not shame this for them and think it\u2019s 100 percent worth exploring.",
    "I did not see this post you're talking about, but based on this description alone, I have concerns.\n\nTo tell someone that they should 'stop that' because they are having feelings for their therapist seems like it would be very invalidating and isolating. We cannot control our feelings, only our actions. If a person develops romantic feelings, they can't help that.\n\nNow, if a client is trying to be forceful with the therapist, and cross boundaries such as touching or finding them at home or in public, that is a problem. In this kind of situation a client would be considered dangerous.\n\nBut in many cases people have these feelings but they aren't crossing boundaries, they're just trying to deal with it. It can already feel shameful to feel this way about a professional. So for a group of people to tell someone to stop as if it's wrong, is not helpful at all. You can't just 'stop'. You have to work through it to come to a resolution. Just trying to ignore it or pretend it's not there will only further impact that person in a negative way.\n\nI don't mean to go off on you or anything, and it's true I did not read this post and comments myself. But I think it's important to explain more about this perspective, because a lot of people try to struggle with it alone, feel guilty, and the don't get anywhere. In order to heal the wounds from this unmet need, it's important to have a supportive figure there to talk about it.",

Im honestly terrified its going to come up again with my current T.\n\nMy parent also has the DSM and I saw that they checked off symptoms of BPD that I feel they observed in me. I honestly just want to get a screening so I can stop thinking that something is mentally wrong with me.",
    "Yep, favorite person. BPD lingo lol.",
    ">for a group of people to tell someone to stop as if it's wrong, is not helpful at all.\n\n1000%. Not only is it not helpful, it's destructive and woefully ignorant. And I say that without meaning to imply that the people who say this are ill-intentioned, because they're probably not. But to pathologize or try to eradicate a client's attachment or attraction? It runs fundamentally *counter* to a healthy approach to therapy. There are even schools of thought that would maintain that such attractions/attachments are a \"jackpot,\" a *goal* of therapy, a distilled source of psychic contents to be observed, processed, and if necessary, healed.\n\nI don't harbor such feelings for my therapist, but far be it from me to get complacent about it, as though I'm doing \"better\" than others. Heck, I think it might even help me if I could access that experience.\n\nEdit: I did not mean to imply that the other user here was being \"complacent\"!

    "I think he knows, and I think he is ok with it.\n\nI\u2019m not sloshed at all. Everyone in my life knows I drink wine slowly but steadily from like 2pm til bedtime. I\u2019m rarely actually drunk, but a little wine makes me me.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend it, I don\u2019t condone it. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s ok. But it\u2019s become a thing in my life and I genuinely don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything wrong. As I said, everyone in my life \u2014 my bf, my parents, my friends, even my boss \u2014 knows I do this, and most of them have verbalized to me directly that it\u2019s a nonissue. Yes, my boss told me I\u2019m allowed to drink on the job. That\u2019s how not drunk I am when I do this.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with this: my psych md knows I do this. She\u2019s said it\u2019s a great, healthy strategy to avoid taking shards, halves, or a whole Xanax. I\u2019ve been prescribed Xanax since before I knew what it was. I was just a kid. And now when I don\u2019t take enough Xanax in a day, I get sick. Wine has a really similar effect on my body, but I have a million times more control over the dose. I take two sips of wine about every half hour, and everyone\u2019s the better for it.",
    "Oh yeah, for sure!  Wasn't trying to question/doubt you, was just curious about someone else's experience.  I have insanely bad anxiety to the point I am agoraphobic and haven't been able to do basic care things like go to the dentist/doctor because of panic attacks...  I just got my xanax prescription last night, am eager to try it though.  She said it was a light dose so I hope I will be ok.  I wonder what it would have been like to have my anxiety at least acknowledged as a child though instead of abused for it (not saying xanax is good for kids, idk anything about it yet, and from what you say I definitely wouldn't have wanted it then).  I've been on the bad side of being medicated with crap as a kid though (therapist says it counts as mental health munchausen's by proxy) so I really do get you...\n\nI totally get the light drinking thing too.  With cptsd/gad, and probably adhd, I am more anxiety than I am human.  The only way I can go out or be around other people is to drink, but I am a light drinker as well!  Though I do like to get a little tipsy, it's the only way to push past anxiety, so more than a couple sips.  I don't even drink every day, and I just have somewhere between half a glass of wine to maybe 3 glasses if it's an all day event.  I've tried weed (because they say it is healthier), the strain everyone says is calming, and it just causes me to have panic and asthma attacks.  At this point I am just desperate to have a life worth living...  Can't even sleep without freaking out all night sometimes (nightmares, night terrors, flashbacks, etc).  And all I mean by babbling on like this is to let you know I am the last person on earth who will judge someone else on their mental health coping methods, and I do understand alcohol can be used responsibly!  So I hope I haven't offended you in any way and you have a good day!\u2661",

See, I too can make assumptions based on your point of view, but that doesn't mean that I'm right because I don't know you.\n\nAlso let's not act like OP was in a genuine state of discomfort. Setting up her camera and posing for photos is not my idea of viewing somebody with genuine discomfort. I really despise your point of view regarding my abilities to view somebody in discomfort. I think it's bullshit quite honestly.",

    "ah, see i'm using cringe as a shorthand for shame and general punitive feelings. shame is The Right Thing To Feel but it's unpleasant. it's Good And Right And Decent to be ashamed, yes, but it's Cringe To Display Any Genuine Emotions, Including Shame. other people can do it, but if i do it it's Bad And Ungood, and generally if i'm cringing at someone else doing it, it's just because of my own feelings. \n\nand for what it's worth, i think this was a good thing to post. i think you made something relatable and aesthetically pleasing that evokes an honest, if uncomfortable, feeling in the viewer. that to me is a good piece of content/art.",
    "Interesting take on shame! I have been ashamed of my shame for a while, having bought into the ideal that a Good Person is perfectly in touch with themselves and emotionally healthy and works through difficulties by reaching out to friends and family, and takes shame and turns it into a thoughtful podcast or a million dollar app, something which they then celebrate with their fifty closest friends at a restaurant in the city that serves only sustainably grown vegan food.\n\nI think I got this from hipster culture and too many profiles of rising young professionals and entrepreneurs. It's a very 21st century point of view imo. See also: toxic positivity. \n\nI'm not sure that it would be any easier to think that shame is Good and Righteous, though. I like how it's sort of torturous either way.",
    "This has made me stop to consider what the difference is for me that makes some emotions in some situations fine, but other emotions in other situations unacceptable. Which I guess means I have a new journaling assignment. I think for me emotions are generally fine, but wants and needs are unacceptable. Like my self harm scars aren't shameful because they say \"I may be in pain, but I have the decency to handle it myself and keep myself in line.\"\n\nAnd thank you. My therapist has commented on the crystal clear body language I show in session and I thought it was kind of funny. I'm glad it's relatable, though I'm also sorry it's relatable, y'know?",

Whats worse is thinking if they made it or not.  A few were suicidal such as myself and i still wonder to this day if they're still alive. One lady was an alcaholic.

    "I\u2019m definitely this kind of person. \n\nAt first I hated the fact that I felt like I was wasting a day by prioritising a therapy session that only took up an hour of my day. But it wasn\u2019t until a month ago where I came out of a session and had a scheduled presentation to do for work right afterwards. I could\u2019ve rearranged it, but I crammed that day full thinking I could handle it all. It wasn\u2019t until the hour after my session that I realised \u2018wow, I do NOT feel in the best headspace to do this properly\u2019. \n\nIt\u2019s never a day wasted when you\u2019re figuring out important steps in facing trauma or getting over something. There\u2019s plenty of time for \u2018work\u2019.  Most people don\u2019t leave any time to get to know themselves or resolve things that have held them back for years. \n\nIn a year\u2019s time you might look back on that hour  you spent with your T every Wednesday and realise it was the most pivotal hour of the week for you to get where you\u2019re at.",
    "I'm absolutely this person, too.. Therapy is at 4pm, so I have to leave work by 2pm to give me chance to get home and into therapy mode. Which means I need to be done with lunch by 1.30pm, so I have lunch at 12.15 because I can't have it later in case something happens to push it back (spoiler: nothing ever happens, but you know. Anxiety.). That means my last meeting of the day can be no later than 11am. I get my Zoom details through for the session between 9am and 10am when my T does her admin, and I can't settle until that email has come through. Which leaves me a window of around 1 hour between 10am and 11am to be productive, which doesn't happen because I need to leave work in 3-4 hours so I don't mess up my therapy routine. So yeah, therapy days are a special kind of day..!",
    "I\u2019ve learned that this is part of my own ADHD and anxiety. If I have an appointment I literally cannot do anything and I will obsess over it until it\u2019s time. Sometimes I arrive 10-15minutes early and especially with therapy I recheck the appointment time multiple times while I\u2019m waiting(mine are in person again). This is also why I hate working the mid shift at work, I do it with everything. It\u2019s like anticipation dysfunction.",
    "I see mine every Tuesday at 7pm. I request to be done with work by 3 that day (Just because when I was in IOP summer 2020 it started at 4 and I've since been done for over a year but it's useful for therapy night) and I usually get done somewhere around then but occasionally the person who does our scheduling will forget and put me until 6. I work in a vet clinic and we close at 6, but doesn't necessarily mean we will be leaving then. I tell my coworkers to hurry tf up and let's close cuz I have an \"appointment\"!!!!",

However, I just wish I knew what I'm progressing towards, and it gets me down with this dreaded feeling like its all adding up to nothing.\n\n I don't know why, but I always struggle with these types of cognitive dissonance.",
    "I've tried that before. Been like ah she'll be right and tried to go to work after therapy. Spoiler alert she was not right. Very far from right. I was exhausted and felt exposed and vulnerable all day\n\nFor now this hour is important because it has to be. I'm digging into deep stuff earlier than I thought. I'm digging into pain and fear. I'm digging into the place I keep a scared little girl who wants a Mommy. And that shit is hard. SO for now Wednesday is a write off. But it won't always be.

    "I was the same. I tried to take my life at 16 and ended up in the hospital for a while. One night I couldn't sleep so I was talking with one of the night nurses, Rev, while I waited for my sleep aid meds to kick in. Somehow we got onto the topic of what I would like to do when I grew up, at which point he said I'd make a great counsellor. He said there was just something about my demeanour that was calming, he also said that I \"oozed compassion\". I'd been interested in psychology for a few years but it was that moment that I decided I wanted to be a therapist. That goal kept me going, and it still does. Last week a client told me that I saved his life, that if it wasn't for me he probably wouldn't be here. Comments like that remind me that I made the right choice. I don't want to make it sound like my life is all sunshine and roses, because it isn't. But everytime things seem like they're becoming too much, I just remind myself that I've got an important job to do.",

    "Omg I\u2019m in the same boat! It\u2019s something I was thinking of casually after several years in therapy, but my therapist\u2019s absolute delight when I told him what I was thinking clinched it for me. He\u2019s said several times since then what an amazing therapist he thinks I\u2019ll be.",
    "Congrats!!! I\u2019ve been thinking for a long time about going back to school, possibly for a counseling or social work degree. I love seeing others do it!",

    "I'm a crazies separatist, but I wish you luck in your endeavors. We may be rivals, but let's save our battles for the plush furniture. Its a good day to die, or work out some issues.",
    "Wow, I'm sure you will be an amazing therapist! Well done!\n\nI did the same, even though I started again from scratch with an undergrad degree. Long way to go but I'm so so happy for all of us who made it!",
    "Same! I\u2019m almost done with my second quarter in an MSW program and am so happy I made this decision. Starting my internship soon and things are finally starting to feel \u201cright\u201d",
    "I\u2019m in school for psychology and also have mental health issues as well",
    "Same here! Have been in therapy for four years; am starting my CMHC grad program in May. :) Congratulations in advance!",
    "Congratulations! This is amazing. I'm happy for you. I've had some thoughts over the past year about doing something similar. Perhaps this was the extra little push I needed to give it more serious thought.",
    "Wow, wonderful! Did you have to take out student loans?",
    "Oh that\u2019s so awesome! I\u2019d love to hear all about everything! \ud83d\ude03",

    "Aww yay you, that\u2019s amazing!! So cool!",
    "What made you want to become a therapist?",
    "My therapist (who\u2019s been one for almost 30 years) telling me I would be good at it several times made me think I will at least try to be a good one!",
    "u/TheCounsellingGamer could you message me? I'd like to pick your brain about something psychology related, I've tried starting a chat but reddit is being temperamental.",
    "Aww thank you! And that\u2019s awesome! I already had an MA but in a completely different field than psychology lol (Arabic)! I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll go for the LPC license. Best of luck to you too!!",
    "Im curious why you\u2019re on the fence? What program were you accepted to? (As in, counseling? Social work?)",
    "Umm what \ud83d\ude05",
    "That\u2019s amazing!!! \ud83d\ude03",
    "Spent 4 years as a teacher -- then 9 as a software developer -- then decided to get back to something more service-oriented and got a 3yr MSW. Currently working towards my LICSW while also doing some post graduate training in Psychodynamic Therapy. I work full time in an outpatient setting. It's hard work and I'm gonna be poor for a while...... But I've got no regrets.",
    "I initially entered my social work master's program without actually realizing that you could be a therapist with a social work degree! I was just looking for a career that was more service-oriented, because I knew that would be more fulfilling than what I was doing. But once I was in the program, I realized that the stuff that really made me feel passionately interested and vitalized always had to do with therapy.",
    "In my past jobs I spend a lot of hours counseling my peers, managers and beyond (yes, I am aware that I am taking a pay cut but this is more fulfilling to me). I was credited for saving a coworker\u2019s marriage and he wrote one of my recommendations letter.",
    "What were you doing to make them say that :)?",
    "Sure, message sent.",
    "Social work! I'm on the fence mostly because right now I'm going through a bit of a transformative period. My long-term relationship just ended and I'm thinking about moving states. So, when everything was stable, I was thinking about going back to school. But now I'm thinking of moving, possibly leveling up in my current career to make some more money. So I think my overall life situation just kind of changed pretty much overnight. So it's just having me question everything I thought I wanted to do and if it's what I still wanted to do.",
    "I think I just have a lot more work to do on the client side\ud83e\udd2d. Maybe a little jealous. Congrats and good luck!",
    "That\u2019s so cool! I\u2019ve spent 8 years as a freelance professional literary translator after getting my MA. I amso excited to start this next step though!! Can\u2019t wait to work with real people\u2019s narratives lol!",
    "Thank you for the insight! I applied to go back for my MSW (I am 34) with the intention of going into private practice afterwards. I guess what I'm struggling with is: I am interested in psychology and learning about theraputic practices but I am struggling if I'm interested in it insofar as it helps explain ME to myself. I'm questioning if I want to take it to the next level and help others.\n\nI feel so torn!",
    "Haha you\u2019d have to ask her ;)",
    "Thank you",
    "That makes sense. When do you need to decide by?",
    "If you are a literary translator, I'd guess you're very good at verbal expression, which will serve you very well as a therapist!",
    "I can definitely see that. I certainly can't speak to the question of whether it will be right for you, but I know that my interest in my own problems, traumas, and suffering is a huge part of the reason why psychology is so interesting for me. I think this is true for many, if not most, of the people that go into the field. I also think people who have experienced their own intense mental health problems can often use this to power their own healing efforts for their clients (although we have to be careful not to over identify with our clients or make the assumption that we have been through the same things they have).",
    "Would be worth asking your therapist for specifics if you haven\u2019t yet! I\u2019m looking into going into therapy myself, and my therapist said that in addition to the traits I have that other therapist friends said would make me a good therapist, I have a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d. It\u2019s nice to get specifics from those that encourage us to pursue this field",
    "I've been accepted to one out of the two schools I applied to. I'm still waiting to hear back from the other. The first one I have until May 15th. So I'm going to try to talk to some therapist friends before deciding. I think I just really need to do some soul searching as to what my next steps need to be. Because I feel like going to school and starting a new career would be committing to staying in my current state for at least the next 5 years. And I'm not sure I really want that at this point.",
    "Thank you!",
    "I appreciate you sharing that insight! I'm trying to talk to more people before committing to it. I have until May 15th to commit and am still waiting to hear back from 1 more school.",
    "Oh I\u2019ve had her repeat it and elaborate several times ;) I value her view of me so much and it\u2019s made me have a lot more self compassion \u2764\ufe0f",
    "Also makes sense. But - wouldn\u2019t it just be two years? Are these two year MSW programs? Couldn\u2019t you pursue licensure in a different state after your program is done?",
    "That\u2019s great!",
    "I would only be able to go part-time since I support myself on a single income, so most of the part-time programs take 3-3.5 years :/. I could probably do it in 3. If I'm crazy, I guess i can try to go to school full-time and work full-time. My job isn't very hard most of the time so it might be doable. Then I'd get done in about 2 years. \n\nI'm also really committed to not taking on more debt, so both of these are in-state programs that would cost ~10k-$14k/year without assistance. It about doubles to 20-30 if I leave the state.\n\nI guess for licensing, I thought most state schools prepare you for taking the test in that state. Maybe that's not the case? I need to research more",
    "I don\u2019t actually know to be honest! But it\u2019s definitely worth investigating.",
    "Thanks for all the feedback. Talking to you actually made me feel excited again about pursing therapy as a career. I also looked into it and it looks like lots of folks work and go to school full-time. My work is going \"remote first\" (we've been at home since March) and one of the program I applied to is online, so I think full-time school and work may be doable in 2 years!",
    "It won't be a walk in the park but many people have done it! Whatever you choose to do I wish you well. I'm glad I could help in some way.",
    "awe this is so cute I love it",
    "That's adorable! They are going to love it \ud83d\ude0d",
    "Aw my one year theraversary is this week! I made a card too and wanted to post it here, but since I posted it on my social media, I didn\u2019t want friends to know this was my Reddit account! \n\nThis is so great! Is it watercolor?",
    "I love this!",
    "i am a T and i would LOVE if a client did this for me!",
    "You\u2019re so talented!! It\u2019s beautiful!",
    "This is such a sweet gesture. I am sure it will touch your T",

    "[deleted]",
    "\ud83e\udd23",
    "Priceless!",
    "I actually did send it to him.  Lol!  He thought it was hilarious!  Luckily we have the same sense as of humor.  I always tell one joke per session and so far they\u2019ve all been hits!  Nothing like a good joke to relax before talking about deep stuff.",
    "My psychologist asked me to try a role play to be direct with someone. I dissociated hard at that! lol  Yet I will chase a bear out of garbage without hesitating...",
    "These are so awesome!",
    "So cool to learn the person behind these comics is a computer nerd like me\ud83d\udc9c",
    "Right?!?!",
    "This hit me right in the 99%-ile trait agreeableness.  I would rather get into a fist-fight than a verbal altercation.",
    "People can hurt more deeply than a bear \ud83d\ude1e I feel you",
    "Comics are fun but they don\u2019t pay the bills! Lol",
    "This happens to me very often. I now try to write down my emotions on my phone\u2019s notes or something and then I simply bring it up like \u201cI may seem fine now because the sun is out today and whatnot but last week [expose what I wrote down]\u201d. It\u2019s actually a bit devastating because if you were feeling fine, you will be brought back to that time and those emotions and it will feel unsettling, but I think it helps me communicate with my therapist. I don\u2019t know if you have this option, but when having a really bad crisis I try to write them down messages or emails so they bring it up next session and we can discuss things.",
    "Not crisis as such but I go blank in my sessions \n\nSo during the week things will come up related to stuff we talk about and I may struggle or feel unsettled. The day of therapy I could tell you exactly what I want to talk about with my T \n\nI get in the room sit on that couch and boom. Total blank as if everything had been fine during the week and I had no struggles. Its damn frustrating",
    "Echoing what some have said about writing things down in the moment or shortly after. This happens to me nearly every time, especially because I tend to feel good on days that I go to therapy, just generally optimistic and motivated to take care of myself. Luckily, I\u2019ve been able to schedule my appointments so that I have an hour of free time before to look through my notes and figure out what I want to say. At first it felt kinda contrived, but my T says that it\u2019s helpful for both of us to really work on what I need to. It usually ends up breaking my thoughts down and can be hard to do/ put myself back in those thoughts, but it\u2019s better than aimlessly chatting for an hour.",
    "I was JUST talking to my T about this in our last session. I dip to some low points in between sessions & then by the time the next appointment rolls around I walk in like nothing happened.",
    "Every. Single. Time.",
    "Oh yeah. Or sometimes I even feel resistant to having my session because at that point I don\u2019t feel like talking about my break down from earlier in the week, day, etc. But that usually tells me that I actually have a lot to work on so I try to push through.",
    "This is a big reason why people might be discouraged to go to therapy all together. The best time to be vulnerable is when you\u2019re clear, if you\u2019re in crisis you aren\u2019t really rationalizing or perceiving like you normally would. Both sides are extremely important in therapy, but also being honest with your therapist of this exact thought can help them go a different route as well. Good luck friend, you\u2019re going to be okay.",
    "I\u2019ve been there with panic.. I usually bring it up and we talk about it anyway, or if I have had a really rough week, I often will perk up the day before session, so sometimes I will email her saying it\u2019s been a hard week due to xyz, can you please help me talk about it. I figure that\u2019s what she is there for.",
    "Yup 100%",
    "All the time.",
    "Sure do! My T said I could email her and describe things if I wanted to, but mostly I just try to log it in my mood journal - I pull that thing up every week when I inevitably forget all about what I wanted to discuss. I use Daylio, just in case that sounds useful.",
    "Yes, all of the time. I try to write down my issue while I'm in the midst of the crisis but then I am hesitant to tell him, because I'm not sure he'll buy the seriousness of it.",
    "All the time! I finally got smart and messaged in between when I had stuff come up. Only talked once after first week\u2019s message. Don\u2019t know how it will be going on, but really helped last time. Took me awhile to recall enough, but it works...",
    "It happens to me a lot. And it bugs me that it never happens during a session. I talk about all this traumatic stuff and leave the session feeling a little exhausted, but all in all I feel fine. Then when I get home I start to cry and want to selfharm or something",
    "Yes, and I write it all down (as you would dreams if you want to remember them), because otherwise I *forget* the feelings ever happened once they're over, and am a polite blank at my next therapy session. My lifelong coping mechanism has been repression, so I don't always have access to my emotions until a \"crisis\" or \"breakdown\" moment happens, seemingly out of nowhere. I used to think I was \"fine\" between each emotional spike, but now I think I'm just... disconnected. \n\nIt's probably because I've kept *myself* at such an emotional distance that I'm not privy to things till they're an emergency... considering how intensely judgmental I was with my emotions in the past, that's makes sense \ud83d\ude05",
    "Yes",
    "This is so relatable. I experience it a lot. I've started journaling when ii feel this way so I can bring it in to therapy even if it feels like its not relevant anymore.",
    "It\u2019s probably very normal and even good that you are solving your crisis and getting out of harmful thoughts on your own strength. Also we are not in a permanent feeling or emotion so changing emotions between sessions is perfectly normal :)",
    "This happens to me often, so I started keeping a notepad full of my prior thought processes so I can bring it up to my therapist later. My therapist looked at me a bit odd, so I don't know if that's normal or not.",
    "I\u2019ve heard a great quote that goes \u201cproblems caused by isolation cannot be solved in isolation\u201d. Some issues are so deep and all encompassing that being alone with them will naturally lead to feeling unstable. I get this exact same feeling myself and something that helps me is reminding myself that I need more context. When things feel unimaginably difficult to comprehend, I believe it\u2019s because we see something in our past without the context of what forged our minds and assume that is who we are.",
    "I talk about what happened in crisis mode. I generally talk about my whole week, the good, the bad, and the neutral.\n\nI have autism though, so maybe that\u2019s not what I\u2019m supposed to do, but my therapist hasn\u2019t complained lol",
    "All. The. Time. \n\nFortunately, I'm such a basket case I always find something to talk about.",
    "Well, it IS all in your head. Where else would it be? In your sock drawer?",
    "I often find that when I do this not only do I not have any emotional connection to what I wrote anymore, but it feels off...as if some other person wrote it. \n\nI fully remember writing it but the headspace is alien and inaccessible, and I question whether I really meant what I wrote at all or if I contrived it in an attempt to understand what I was feeling?\n\nNot discounting the value of the advice at all I just wonder wtf is good with me lol",
    "Same here ! That's why the hour before therapy I grap whatever paper and write a list of what I'd like to talk about so that I can check it mid-session and see if I mentioned the most important subjects",
    "Oh, I feel like this, too. Now that I trust my therapist, on days I know I have a session, I'll feel better simply at the *prospect* of validation and emotional relief. I write down and articulate whatever I want to work on beforehand as well, when I feel able. Sometimes it's as blunt as, \"I'm coming off pretty stable right now, but that's because I'm doing the thing where I perform competence instead of being vulnerable. I'm actually finding it super hard to get out of bed\". \n\nLike, I hide stuff SO well, even from myself. I can't expect my therapist to be a mind reader. She's done the work of gaining my trust, and I gotta do the work to step out of my comfort zone, so I *can* be helped... \"Aimlessly chatting for an hour\". Yup \ud83d\ude05",
    "No, I definitely can relate to this too! I have also felt this way. To be honest, it\u2019s a process! Sometimes it makes more sense than others, there will be times where you just feel kind of stupid to even mention such thing now that you\u2019re in a good place, but it\u2019s all part of the journey and I think that no matter how you feel about it later on, you should choose to mention it if it had a big impact on you, because even your interpretation of it later on carries a meaning to your therapist and to yourself. The more times you do this the \u201cbetter\u201d and more accurate your descriptions of those moments will feel, and the embarrassment kind of starts to fade a bit with time - not always though, but with time. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you, OP! From where I see it, you just need to find a better way to communicate with yourself on those moments, and think how that could translate the best way into a conversation that you feel is relevant with your therapist. Have you tried mentioning how you feel about this with your therapist? Maybe they have a better mechanism for you that could help you more, this is just my experience and we all operate in different ways.",
    "Ahaha, I get this exact thing along with what seems like a total personality shift.  So I've tried not only writing it down, but then texting/emailing before the session...  But then I just all of a sudden switch again by the next session...  I've questioned OSDD-1, but I seriously feel like I was just exaggerating and I'm forcing myself to try to fit in that box, and maybe I am just weird (attention seeking and immature excuses)?xD",
    "Agreed. I journal when I\u2019m in \u201ccrisis mode\u201d between sessions, but then when I try to use my journal in session I get really embarrassed like I was overreacting or being dramatic when I wrote the entries.",

    "Jesus that seems complaint worthy. What a manipulative fuck.\n\nEdit: you did GREAT seeing this BS for what it was and moving on. Someone who was early in emotional recovery, had very low self esteem, or was otherwise extra vulnerable could easily internalize this abusive behavior and decide that it's normal. I'm actually scared and outraged for this person's other clients. An ineffective or rude psychologist is one thing, but behavior from a psychologist that could potentially affect a person's perception of how they should be treated, for the worse, is downright harmful and dangerous when working with traumatized or emotionally struggling people.",
    "Okay, so glad you are not seeing this person again. I\u2019d report him to his governing body and write him a letter. He was consistently disrespectful of your time and when someone is that late it\u2019s perfectly normal to \u201cgo home\u201d. He was essentially robbing you.",
    "Do people actually think it\u2019s appropriate to behave this way in a work setting? Let alone a psychologist? I\u2019m so sorry he did that to you.",
    "What an asshole.  Is he self employed, or does he work for another company.  I'd ask him for a refund for that session that you paid for...the one where you waited 12 minutes?  Ask him to see the Zoom (or whatever service was used) reports.  They will show every meeting, who logged in, and what time they logged in.  \n\nIf he works for someone else, go to the office manager with this request.\n\n\"I think we'd both benefit from being more respectful of other people's time.  Since we're on that topic, can you refund me for the <date> session, when I logged in on time and then logged out after 12 minutes because you hadn't joined the meeting?  Your company's Zoom records will show my (and your) login and logout times on that date.\"",
    "WTF. Dump this guy. That is horrible!!! So sorry you experienced that.",
    "I\u2019m so mad this happened to you because it is wholly irresponsible and completely unacceptable. You paid him for time that he did not provide a service, a time in which he did not respect YOUR TIME, and then he follows up with abandoning you entirely? Assuming by that point in the relationship he was already aware of your needs and concerns about abandonment? \n\nNo way. Report him.\n\nI would have been a total wreck over that so I hope you are able to find a real professional and remember it\u2019s Ok to hold professionals to reasonable standards of professionalism, including time management. You are paying them to help you, not play games to control you.",
    "You didn't no-show. He no-showed the first time and you gave up waiting. And it sounds like he never even tried to contact you about it. Then he punished you for respecting your own time first chance he got. It's not just unprofessional - if I did that to a friend I wouldn't be surprised if they stopped hanging out with me. I'm sorry he treated you this way.\n\nEta since you asked for experiences: not nearly as bad, but my last therapy was kind of similar. It was group therapy attached to a hospital and our therapists were consistently late, cancelled the day prior, or even sent me home when I had already arrived. On the other hand if one of us ever was late it was a huge thing where you'd have to analyse the deeper meaning every time and get scolded by a nurse like you're a toddler. Over time, it made me feel too disrespected, so I quit and went to a private practice instead. Huge relief.",
    "File a complaint to the board! He has no business \"helping\" people. Save that voice-mail and those call logs. That's your evidence. Fuck this person!",
    "That is incredibly disturbing. I hope you'll find a GOOD psychologist very soon!\n\nBad professionnals do exist :(",
    "Jesus christ, you should report him. He doesn't deserve a license if he's going to treat his clients like that.",
    "What a dick. He can't be normal and just charge you for it? I personally wouldn't trust someone this passive-aggressive with my feelings.",
    "Please write a complaint or a review online. Warn other people. He shouldn't be a therapist.",
    "T (in training) here.  Wow. The gall of the therapist projecting his time management issues onto you, then claiming that his inability to manage his schedule was really him teaching you a lesson. \nNothing about this is acceptable. If you haven't rage-deleted that voicemail, consider sharing it with the licensing board in your area, or at least with the agency for which he works. This guy is dangerously out of touch, and his treatment of you amounts to gaslighting. \nYou deserve your money back, an apology, and a new therapist.",
    "Wtf? Therapy is not the time for pettiness. He is sounds like someone wants to control other people.",
    "Please PLEASE report him, if he did it to you then he\u2019s doing it to other patients. Dude needs to find a new job, maybe not in customer service tho with that attitude",
    "What an awful psychologist!! Hope you are able to find a better therapist\u2019",
    "I haven't experienced something like this, but I hope you conveyed this message to him:\n\n>I'm not interested in seeing a psychologist who engages in exactly the kind of retaliatory behavior that I'm trying to fix in myself.\n\nI hope you told him this because it is a very calm and true way of saying this when you could have totally been more mean with it. Also, he needs to hear this. It would (hopefully) show to him how messed up his behavior is.",
    "I'm reading this post for the second time and realizing this guy held a grudge for *eight months*.  Even discounting the fact that his lateness was his own fault, that's an impressive level of pettiness.",
    "Is your psychologist 12? Jesus. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou did not no-show. He did. The fact that he expects you to respect his time but he has no respect for yours says volumes. I hope you tell him exactly why you won't continue with him.",
    "[deleted]",
    "That is so fucking infuriating. The absolute GALL of that asshole, oh my god. I would be so angry and irritated if I were you. I can\u2019t believe he seriously decided to resort to playing petty when literally everything that transpired in the entire duration of your therapy with him was HIS FAULT. You were completely justified for no-showing in that last session, by the way!! He sounds like such an insecure and egotistical man-baby.",
    "Indeed, just wow! That is one fucked up, power abusive, narcissistic, patronizing, acting out therapist.",
    "So many psychologists have their own fucked up issues. I'm sorry this happened to you. He sounds like a real narcissistic wanker. I hope you can find a better psychologist.",
    "My psych is ALWAYS late. Like in 2 years she has never been on time. But she always medsages and says she'll be 10-15 late and I get my allocated time. I had a previous psych once would would start 20 mins late and make me finish on time/never give me the time I was paying for. One time she deliberately kept me talking about mundane things like what I was cooking for dinner and then because I was 2 mins over the allocated 50 she charged me for an \"extended session\". On my receipt it actually said 52 mins - extended session. These people are bullshit and a disgrace to the profession.",
    "Therapist here. It sounds like, in many ways, he felt as if he were in a one up position. For example, I expect you to follow my rules, but I don\u2019t have to follow yours. \n\nFor some of us, we get that example from the medical community: if I am more than 10 mins late to the doctor I have to reschedule- but it is perfectly okay for me to wait an hour for her. \n\nFor therapists, I think it is different in that we are modeling positive relationship dynamics for our clients. \n\nI am a therapist that often runs 4-7 mins late for an appointment. If it is more than 7, I always text my client to ensure I am coming. I ALWAYS apologize for being tardy. \n\nI would NEVER say to a client \u201cif you have learned to respect my time you can reschedule.\u201d \n\nI often get frustrated with this sub because we are also so quick to recommend firing the therapist without understanding how this invalidates the clients work. However, in this case.... yea, this guy has to go.",
    "Whenever my therapist would be late they would tell me and extend the session a bit to make up for their lateness. This psychologist sounds awful tbh like if I acted like that at work (I work in a corporate setting) I\u2019d be getting an earful and might lose my job since it\u2019s TOTALLY unprofessional. Good for you for declining the offer!! It\u2019s ironic that a mental health professional can\u2019t even communicate well.",
    "He sounds abusive and very toxic. If I were you I would report him as he shouldn't be practicing. I hope you are okay \ud83d\udc93",
    "You can absolutely report this person's behavior to your state's psychological board",
    "WOW he sounds HORRIBLE. That\u2019s some massive manipulative and controlling behavior by him. Wtf. Pls report him",
    "Ummm that\u2019s extremely immature and selfish of your psychologist considering YOU\u2019RE PAYING HIM!\n\nCut him off. What an asshole.",
    "Good mental health care providers are consistent and calm. This man is unpredictable and petty. I would send the recording to his licensing board.",
    "Totally unacceptable. Glad you\u2019re out of there. I would not pay for that session. HE no showed. That\u2019s on him. Cancel the check or however you paid. If he bills your insurance, that\u2019s fraud. \nAnd yes, to all the things you\u2019re doing, the reviews, the reporting. That dude has some serious work to do on himself.",
    "I highly, highly recommend reporting this. That\u2019s two sessions you\u2019ve paid for and didn\u2019t receive, if I hear correctly, which he DELIBERATELY missed AND charged for. At minimum, I would consider this accepting payment without rendering services. You know, stealing.",
    "Holy hell this man child should not be in this position. Please report him OP! Sorry you had to deal with this, you did nothing wrong.",
    "That dude should not be getting paid to be a psychologist that's insane.",
    "This person has their own issues. Best to find someone more caring. I mean, how did he not know that something bad happened had not happened to you? I mean, did he call to see if you were ok or anything? He immediately went into punish mode. He\u2019s a professional; that behavior is beneath him.",
    "please write a yelp review for this guy lol",
    "I would honestly report that behavior to the licensing board. Psychologists/therapists can\u2019t just act petty as shit to make their point. They should know they are working with people experiencing adversity in their lives already, being a passive aggressive dick is very unprofessional and unethical.",
    "I think that\u2019s worthy of a complaint to the medical board wherever you are",
    "I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you but happy at the same time you didn\u2019t scheduled another appointment and decided to change",
    "[removed]",
    "Horrified reading what happened to you. This is reportable to his licensing board...it is abandonment of a patient and absolutely NOT ok.",
    "These stories reassure me that I am not a garbage/toxic therapist. Nice to know that the actual stories of unethical therapists are things I could never do and the mistakes that actually keep me up at night pale in comparison.",
    "Oh.. my.. goodness.. that\u2019s unreal. First of all.. if a client is late to doctors appointments, they typically say like 10 minutes or so they\u2019ll make you reschedule and come back. Usually with therapists if the client is late they let you use up the remaining time but they\u2019ll also let you know it\u2019s not ideal and I\u2019ve seen policies that if it\u2019s a habitual thing they will charge you or stop scheduling appointments. Basically what I\u2019m getting at is that there is a window of time if a client is late there is some kind of notice or consequence. He, the professional, was more than 10 minutes late to the appointment. Did he really expect you to sit there indefinitely. He was late, you waited, he didn\u2019t show up, you left. He made the assumption that you were a no-show instead of realizing it was his behavior causing the problem. And his dumb ass assumption caused him to make an ass of himself by retaliating. \n\nBUT even if you were a straight up no show this is beyond unprofessional of him. It should honestly be reported. Someone who is this dysfunctional and unreasonable should not be allowed anywhere near clients. So petty.. and so harmful to people in vulnerable situations where he\u2019s in a position of authority but acting so condescending. What in the world!\n\nEdit: trust in this kind of relationship is just so important. How could anyone trust him again after pulling a stunt like that! Good grief!",
    "Oof this made me literally feel sick. Like others have said you really didn\u2019t even no show! He is a Jack ass and I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that. Reaching out for therapy is already hard enough.",
    "What a sack of shit he is for doing this to you! Throw a bag of turd at the dicks face!",
    "Is it possible that the appointment you showed up to in person was actually supposed to be virtual?",
    "He sounds really narcissistic",
    "Please report him!!! He\u2019s sorry as hell",
    "REPORT HIM. He needs to be retrained and should not be working until he's developed some freakin empathy.",
    "That\u2019s a whack response and strategy on their behalf. Very immature and retaliatory.",
    "[deleted]",
    "Man, so many people pointing this out - I did not even consider it that way. You\u2019re right, I\u2019ve been sitting here thinking \u201cWell, I did wrong but his reaction to my wrong was WAY worse\u201d\n\nScrew that guy. I\u2019ve already left reviews on Google and a couple healthcare sites, but I\u2019ll have to look into submitting a proper complaint.\n\nEDIT: I'm really glad to read all these responses because I feel so validated that his was a completely bizarre and unacceptable course of action. Of course I already thought that was the case or I wouldn't have refused the offer to make another appt....but there's always that inner dialogue, that seed of doubt telling me \"It wasn't that bad. It wasn't that big of a deal. You're the problem, it must be you.\"\n\nSo these responses help solidify that, in this case, it wasn't me and it was a big deal.",
    "My therapist isn\u2019t a psychologist and even if there a chance she\u2019ll be running even 5/10 minutes late she\u2019ll text me as soon as possible to say she\u2019s running a little late and apologies. You\u2019ve done no different to what I would have done and given up. Even I\u2019ve made the error online of accidentally logging into sessions on the wrong codes but a simple message from my therapist to say you\u2019ve clicked on the wrong link for said session was all it took! \nYou need to look after you and see if you can find someone different as this dude clearly isn\u2019t that right match for you from his part",
    "I'd go so far as to report the behavior.",
    "I\u2019m glad a T responded. I was even starting to question whether it was deserved. Saying it\u2019s toxic really helps keep a grip on self worth and reality. Thanks.",
    "It sounds absolutely manipulative and controlling. Their psychologist *punished* them for his own wrongdoing! Even after he'd gotten paid for the session *he* didn't show up to.\n\nIt makes me very concerned for his other patients.",
    "Good point!",
    "Absolutely! As a therapist, if a client is 5 minutes late for a session, I start reaching out via text or a phone call to see if they've forgotten or might just be running late. If I haven't heard from them 15 minutes after session started, I assume they're not showing, charge them, and close the session. You gave him plenty of time to show up and deserve your money back. Adding my voice to those suggesting you report him to his governing board.",
    "Yeah! I dont get the \"scolding you like a toddler\" but either! Like thanks for being super condescending when you're at fault. Fuck off.",
    "And report him to his licensing board so they can remind him of how to be professional.",
    "Follow up in case you'd like to report him (and I hope you do) - If you're in the states or Canada, you can Google the psychological association in your state and find out who sits on the ethics board and email them for advice on how to proceed. If you're in Maine or NH, send me a pm.",
    "I hadn\u2019t even thought of that. If he\u2019s in over his head, he totally could have forgotten/missed the appt, avoided the client for days, until coming up with the idea to frame it as \u201cteaching you a lesson.\u201d Such a person is not doing ok and needs help before continuing to practice, at best. At worst, they\u2019re that rare but predictable scary breed who is super fucked up and using this profession to act out. Yikes. Regardless, I so hope you report",
    "THANK YOU. That was another reason I kept telling myself at first that it was ridiculous to think he was actually ghosting me....it had been SO LONG since the last interaction that I thought it was vain of me to think he even remembered.",
    "How does a no-show mess up your day? You're still getting paid for your time, right? But instead of talking with the client, you'd be spending the same amount of time, in the same place twiddling your thumbs or whatever it is you do.",
    "It would be unfounded though. He isn\u2019t violating any statues. Unfortunately the board doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re just a jerk.",
    "Therapist also- do you think the board would care? He is being a jerk, but he\u2019s not likely to be violating any statues.",
    "Me too! Whenever I feel like a crappy therapist, I just read these posts.",
    "Not possible. He doesn't do virtual appts at all anymore. He was the one to inform me of this when I made the appointment, and when I texted him the day before to confirm, he was sure to remind me that was the case. \n\nWhich now, looking back, seems even more fucked up because he was clearly planning to ghost me and wanted to make sure I'd take time out of my day to drive to his office.",
    "I hope this was the case. That would be at least somewhat reassuring.",
    "Was just gonna say the same! He must\u2019ve ACED Gaslighting 101!",
    "This is problematic in so many ways I don\u2019t know where to start. There a many other ways to support development of insight around these kinds of issues that aren\u2019t unethical, uncontaining, manipulative, damaging to the relationship, petty, transactional, and on and on.  I can\u2019t fathom a therapist landing on this as the appropriate intervention without it being influenced by personal insecurity far more than clinical wisdom.",
    "Honestly it sounds like he\u2019s the one who no-showed.... twice",
    "Punctuality is such an under appreciated quality in today\u2019s society and I really don\u2019t get why. So many people I know are chronically late to everything. It is so disrespectful to the person you\u2019re supposed to be meeting with! I was raised to be very punctual and it bothers me to no ends that people seem to think agreeing on a time really means anywhere from 10-30 minutes after (sometimes more) is okay. \n\nAnyway, I agree with the others. If I was waiting over 10 minutes for a session to start I likely would have bailed as well. Your therapists time isn\u2019t the only time that is valuable, yours is too.",
    "Did you submit the complaint?",
    "Yeah this is just bad all around. I cant see this being helpful to anyone with any condition in really any situation, and especially not someone with abandonment issues. Not a therapist, just someone who would be pretty disturbed if this was done to me",
    "Yeah, this is one time I am 100% behind this sub's quick jump to... REPORT!!!xDDD\n\nThis dude should not be practicing like this, he could really eff up a vulnerable person...",
    "Agree, it\u2019s awful",

    "Hey that's a nice rock! It looks so smooth, so I bet it's real nice to keep in your hand, along with the weight of it and cool touch. I love the idea of using a rock as a grounding tool! I'm going to have to find a nice rock for myself to use!",

    "I think having an object in therapy that serves as comfort during therapy is very good.

    "Hey! I would take a Teddy bear too! I've actually have asked about it on here ^^' I've actually have taken my teddy bear in my bag but didn't have the courage to bring him out ^^'\n\nEdit: I hope you have the courage to bring them out!",
    "I'll have to look into them because they sound really interesting!",
    "That's a really useful thing to have then!",
    "Thanks!",
    "I have to find more! That'll probably be my next mission once I go to the train again!",
    "I heard of those! Where'd you buy yours?",
    "That's such a nice idea! If you end up making a little buddy I hope you show me! Have you ever heard of the small string voodoo dolls? They were popular when I was a kid! :)",
    "Aw, this is so cute. \ud83e\udd7a Does she know you have it now?",
    "Oooh that looks so soft and fancy! I've had an artist that I listen to recommend a paintbrush and doing the same thing with the bristles! :)",
    "Aww, that's so nice! I have a sesame street blanket (it's toddler sized) but still covers me nice since I am short haha.\n\nEdit: it's also nice to have for the summer heat!",
    "No problem! Glad I could help!",
    "Thanks! And I do the same, I think!",
    "That's so cool! I think if I were to rub it a lot then it'd get a little dent! :)",
    "Thanks! And that's nice to play around with!",
    "I'm sure your cat appreciates all the pets!",
    "Thanks! And I love Pusheen!",
    "That sounds so cool! Do you still have it?",
    "Those are such good ideas! And I love the idea of coloring!",
    "Sadly, I've lost this rock! But I have managed to get some other rocks (not as pretty at this one was) but the difference is is that I now have a dedicated place to put them!",
    "Aw, that's so cute! I'm glad you have that blanket! What has your T said about said blanket?",
    "That's what i wanted to do with this rock, but sadly I've lost it! I can't find it anywhere in my house!",
    "Aw man, I wish I could see it. It says we can't find that page. :(",
    "I've now lost this rock too. :( But I've gotten other rocks and have a dedicated place for them now!",
    "I'm glad you have something to comfort you now!",
    "I've never heard of that. I'll look into that! Thanks!",
    "Rock buddies!",
    "That is so cute! Can you send me a picture? That'd be awesome. The other day I went to Target and they had a Winnie the Pooh and Tigger duckies. It's all I had that I wanted to buy and I thought it was quite funny as the cashier would be like, \"...This dude really *just* came for these duckies and nothing else?...\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
    "That's cute! I've taken my teddy bear before but have just kept him in my backpack when in therapy as I never have the courage to take him out. ^^'",
    "I'm so sorry you went through that.",
    "Nope, I rub it with my thumb to help with my anxiety during sessions.",
    "Your thumb is missing from view, but there\u2019s a baguette in its place (background).\n\nBaguette digits hon hon oui oui",
    "After my session just now, it feels a lot smaller :p but idk. Anyway, i totally think so too. It's funny because my therapist mentioned that her son rubs a rock too... And she hadn't even seen mine. We had to laugh when I showed it.",
    "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 where is this from???",
    "I know! The fabric is so smooth",
    "That\u2019s such a cool fact! Nice username, too :)",
    "It\u2019s a cupcake shaped plushie! \ud83e\uddc1\ud83e\udd70",
    "\ud83e\udd70 awww that\u2019s so cute!",
    "Hahahah I feel so hard. Easier now when I\u2019m muted all the time on zoom",
    "That's so awesome of that other client!",
    "I realized I was collecting so many \u2014 I\u2019d bring them home from like the Grand Canyon, every mountain trip (we live a couple of hours from both the mountains and the beach and have a condo at the beach), every beach trip \u2014 I was obsessed with finding the perfect, smoothest, rock on the beach...I have one from England and Ireland and Scotland each, I have one from Spain.... and I was getting so many I had to do something with them. My husband and I blow glass so we made a little bowl for them!",
    "It was given to me by someone who didn\u2019t want it. I\u2019ve lost contact with that person. Sorry :/",
    "I\u2019ve heard of them and they look super cute! I prefer things that are a bit more on the round side though. I tried making a whale a couple hours ago but I got mixed up and got frustrated and gave up lol. I\u2019ll try again though and I\u2019ll post it here when done!",
    "Oh she definitely knows. I get all upset because I miss her so badly out of session. She encourages me to use this tangible object as a way to remember she's out there somewhere.",
    "Haha I also do this. Not much painting, mostly stimming",
    "She does!",
    "That\u2019s awesome! I\u2019m sorry you lost yours. I actually lost mine or it\u2019s packed a box. I would always rub my thumb on it when I\u2019d get anxious.",
    "Hmm, she doesn\u2019t mind. Thinks it\u2019s way better habit than using coke or any other drugs! Ha.",
    "Love that! It\u2019s sad that u lost it tho.\nI wish my rock was still here..idk where it went, like I live alone no animals and lockdown so I\u2019m nearly never out which means this rock is disappeared in a 2 room Appartement without the possibility to do so",
    "Gosh that sounds super sweet! (It reminds me of when I was a kid and i used to think there were tiny elf\u2019s living in the tiny wholes in our wooden (idk the word, it\u2019s not carpet but also not ground. The opposite of selling u know?) and I used to collect stones for them and build them little beds out of colourful (the thing from sheep\u2019s but not the sheep ones but the plant Version my English shit)",
    "For life!",
    "Yeah my T is really nurturing and is like a mother figure to teach us what a good relationship can be like since my childhood trauma was pretty unique. She will even hug and hold me on the couch while I hold bunny and talk to me in a soothing voice to help calm me down when I become scared and little. She is one in million. Maybe try asking your T if you can bring your teddy to therapy? My T even let me wrap myself in a blankie with bunny last week because we were having a very hard time and just needed love.",
    "You\u2019re a kind soul.  Thank you.",
    "Lmao that's an arm rest xD",
    "[Rifleman's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgd2F2QNfEE)",
    "Aww, that's so cute!",
    "True! :P",
    "Right? [Here\u2019s a picture.](https://imgur.com/a/ZU1Ucho) Apparently I\u2019m bad at estimating size because it\u2019s actually 3.5 inches long \ud83d\ude02",
    "That's so cool that your rocks are all over from the world! I think glass blowing is so cool! But I heard it's hard to get into the industry!",
    "Totally okay! I'm glad it helps you!",
    "Awesome, let me know! :D",
    "I actually ended up finding it haha. I put it where I couldn't lose it!",
    "Gotcha, and if that's the case then I agree with her!",
    "Oh wow, that's so strange then! I like to think dust bunnies took it haha.",
    "Wow, sounds like you were a creative and imaginative kid! \ud83d\ude01",
    "\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a this is so sweet!",
    "I find it hilarious that you actually measured it haha.",
    "That\u2019s awesome! I\u2019m happy you found it :)",
    "Sorry replied to my own message accidentally (wow that word probably wrong) \n\nShould be above your message of u want to read",
    "Nah \ud83d\ude02 my mom didn\u2019t want me to ask shit so she didn\u2019t tell me anything and my grandpa always invented stuff like that to make reality a bit more joyful",
    "Aw, well that was very sweet of your grandpa!",

    "Therapist here- if you feel that way, why are you staying?",

I know you need to have a good connection for therapy to work but idk, it very well could be me...like I rly feel that I\u2019m not good at therapy which maybe sounds dumb but it\u2019s how I feel like I\u2019m open and honest and still get nowhere I feel. I also feel like I might just be too F\u2019d up and have stranger symptoms than normal like dp/dr and severe hyper vigilance and have had a hard time finding any therapist who can help me with those kinds of symptoms Any tips for this poor soul lol? Appreciate anything",
    "\"Something has to give\" = something has to change/be sacrificed.\n\nSo I'm seeing it as a kind of boundary thing, like if someone wants you to sacrifice a need of yours / otherwise cause harm to yourself to make them feel better, instead you deserve to look after yourself by honouring your needs and only doing whatever it is that you're comfortable with.\n\nI can also see it applying to a situation involving just you as well, e.g. if you're struggling with an assignment because you're not feeling well, instead of forcing yourself through it and making yourself ill to complete it, you deserve to prioritise your wellbeing and seek an extension instead.\n\nTl;dr: don't let harm come to yourself to try to \"fix\" things. You matter just as much as anyone else/more than comparatively unimportant things.",
    "same. I mean she didn\u2019t have to pop off but okay jen you do you \ud83d\ude0c",
    "My best advice is to read your reply out loud to your therapist. You have some great insight there.",
    "You\u2019re not bad at therapy! You just haven\u2019t found a personality that you trust/click with yet. And likely not finding a helpful treatment yet. \n\nI\u2019m curious, what treatment does your therapist specialize in? And what types of therapy do they practice? It should say in their website."
