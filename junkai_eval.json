I\u2019ll take responsibility for not giving someone a try to get used to them and foster a shared understanding to communicate better, but I\u2019m not blaming myself when I say \u201cnext\u201d. \n\nSome patients may do what you worry and blame themselves, but I\u2019ve had enough therapists to know that most of the ones I didn\u2019t \u201cclick\u201d with were just unqualified or unqualified for my needs. They were handing me an bandaid when I needed an ace bandage kind of thing, if that metaphor at all works - they weren\u2019t providing the appropriate \u201cmedicine\u201d or weren\u2019t giving it to me in a way I could use/understand.",

Taking one individual's bad experience would be no more fair than judging an entire system off one good experience. I'm sure you can see why I wouldn't want to do that?",
        "Yes! I have felt very much the same way this whole year. I am trying out therapy to see if there is anything to learn that way, but have only been to one session so far so it\u2019s too soon to tell what comes of that. So far on my own I am learning that 1) others can be struggling beneath the surface even if they appear to be handling much more with ease, and 2) that I have some deep rooted anxiety and coping problems that have been exacerbated by the stress of the pandemic and working at home with kids. \n\nThe good news is that I\u2019m also finding that addressing the root of my problems seems to help with many symptoms all at once. On my good days, when I deliberately center myself and fight the confusion and the panic, I am able to calm down and focus and get a lot more out of my time. The picture of where I want to be seems less unreachable and more like a realistic possibility if I were to make keep going in such a way. Easier said than done, of course, but all that to say - you are not alone! It sounds like you are actively trying to figure it out and that takes guts.

I remember my psychiatrist, when I told him I thought of suicide a lot, he asked me if I had a plan-do I have whatever I plan to use, have I set a date, etc? As low as I felt, he said it wasn\u2019t bad enough to \u201c send me up the hill\u201d to inpatient. Lately it\u2019s been bad tho, I said something to my dr at my last appt, she said it\u2019s just situational cuz my life sucks (my words, not hers), and didn\u2019t seem concerned. I\u2019d say I\u2019m usually between a 7 and a 9, and spend most days around an 8. I just worry about how it\u2019ll affect my nephew, as he\u2019s grown quite attached to me, and is old enough to remember me now.

This is about outside influences that took them over, not a reflection of you. They were susceptible to brainwashing and we don\u2019t know if they will one day in the future wake up from it, or not.\n\nSo you need to decide if you want to continue reaching out to them in the hopes of remaining a good influence on them, while simultaneously opening yourself up to continued abuse. Or you can choose to walk away and protect your health and focus on people who deserve your time.

        "Long but hopefully helpful/relatable. Yesterday, I had my termination session with my previous therapist of over a year. I was constantly terrified she was ready to ax me, and despite the fact that we talked about that fear, I still convinced myself to just end things and start with someone new. I mourned for weeks.\n\nTo my surprise, in our last session she actually shared that working with me was like \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d and that our connection was genuine. She admitted to processing, in her own time, the heavier things I shared\u2014that she didn\u2019t just walk away from the emotional bombs I dropped robotically and that she really cared. It was a huge relief to know that sometimes the vulnerable things we share stick with our therapists and they do their own processing with them. Hearing that made me feel incredibly grateful and humbled to know I wasn\u2019t as alone in dealing with the weight of those secrets. \n\nThere was only so much she could share within the treatment framework without triggering my feelings of being a burden, but in that moment I *really* needed to hear that our work mattered to her on a personal level. The thing that nearly broke me was hearing her voice soften as she said, encouragingly\u2014and almost sadly: \u201cAlien, not everyone in your life is going to leave you.\u201d \n\nIt was such a loaded statement because she knew why I terminated. I understood it as her way of saying, \u201c*I was not going to abandon you*\u201d. \n\nIt was an overarching theme to the session. She asked me to trust that people will stick around if I will allow it. The subtext was deafening. Our relationship, as we both had anticipated, was culminating into the same defensive pattern that I had followed my whole life: ending my relationships before they could end me. \n\nIn earlier sessions she revealed hopes that this treatment might model a new and healthier path for me (I\u2019m really sorry that it didn\u2019t). Yet, she still found a graceful way to investigate the fear behind my decision without making me feel ashamed or judged. Thanking me for my honesty and vulnerability, she reassured me that the way this played out was *okay*. She thought I ultimately used good judgment in deciding to work with a more specialized therapist who I could learn to trust the same. \n\nShe set the bar really fucking high for all of my future therapists\u2014my life is so much better having met her, mainly because she first validated my trauma and also fostered my very first safe space where I got to process a lot of \u2018forbidden\u2019 emotions I had never admitted to anyone before. I appreciated that she left the door open for me to drop in again, despite not offering to continue contact with other former clients. My heart is full, I have so much gratitude, and I hope that others with strong attachments to their therapists can feel safe enough to trust that not all of them are actively trying to get rid of us.",

You may think they are perfect and normal but they are human like you and feel similarly to you in many more ways than you think. \n\nSure maybe they have more things to brag about but that doesn't mean they are \"ahead\" as you put it. They're just doing different things than you at different times of their lives. In reality they also feel insecure about themselves in many ways just like you. You can still feel happy with yourself even if it seems like you're doing nothing with your life. \n\nLife never really gets better or worse, only your outlook on it does, and while being in a better spot may affect your outlook on life, you can have a positive outlook on life at any point.

It\u2019s a safe place where you can take risks, try out different ideas or ways of being, see what comes up, and eventually bring these new things into your other relationships.

        "it's very strange to me that you are trying to act like mental illness is a competition. if you really want to play this game, I've been hospitalized 18 times involuntarily. diagnosed bipolar 1 and BPD for over 8 years. I am also working on a certification in counseling after finishing a bachelor's in psychology last year. I currently work at a university hospital. I am also a recovering heroin addict. I am no stranger to mental illness. and nothing I said delegitimized the effects of hypomania or bipolar II. that is an argument you started on your own, with yourself. mania and hypomania can BOTH be debilitating BUT, there is a difference between the two. which is all I'm saying. there's a difference. not 'one is worse than the other' just that they are not the same thing.",
        "I have a 9 year old. I am 43. When she was 2 she had an operation and afterwards she had very bad sleep disturbance and night terrors.  I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia just after she was born and I was half way through a degree and working.\n\nI cannot explain just how tired I was. Spending each night on the floor of her room as she would wake at 12, 2,4 and then up at 6.30am.  On work days I'd be on a bus at 7am.\n\nI daydreamed constantly that I won the lottery and left. I planned exactly what I would do and fantasied about a new life on my own. If I had won then I would have got my passport and ghosted.  100%.\n\nGradually things got better but honestly I would have left then if I could.\n\nI'm certain it would have been the worst mistake of my life but it was what I wanted then in those black times.",

I've only just recently been able to get in-touch with my angry emotions and I was startled how much is there - literally a lifetime's worth of anger balled up inside me.\n\nI wasn't able to express anger in childhood either but I accumulated a lot due to a similar inability to express my social anxiety, and a need to 'tough out' my problems. I suppose it's worth asking yourself where your anger is coming from?",

        "Mine has def improved. I\u2019m a 30 year old female union factory worker. My job is extremely physical and strenuous, but i NEED it for the money and mostly the health insurance. For 11 years from age 18-29 i didnt have health coverage. I saw a few different therapists through referrals from the free clinic i went to, but it didnt really help. Over that decade i was in college for 2.5 years and ended up just not going back one day and leaving bc everything in my life was too much. I live in a very toxic household and started working at age 14, and tried college so i could not end up like my parents... and in that time i tried at least 5 different SSRIs (anti depressants) but they didnt really ever work.\n\nDuring the year prior to me starting my job at Ford (and having health coverage) I was In a very bad place. A new SSRI seemed like it was helping a little bit possibly, but it caused me to do stuff in my sleep and it was scary. I tried a new one and it made me worse, which is something i had felt the SSRIs had always done, thats why i never took them for long. At about age 22 i started to realize more and more that i knew what was wrong with me mentally, but i didnt have the health coverage to actually find out. \n\nAge 29 my insurance was finally in full swing and i made an appointment with a psychiatrist and was finally properly diagnosed. She said that I have bipolar disorder (what i figured it was for years) and that anti depressants actually make you WAY worse and cause you to \u201crapid cycle\u201d...she is still my psychiatrist and i have also been seeing a therapist. Even though I\u2019m really unhappy at my job i need it for the excellent pay, and free, amazing, health insurance. It\u2019s saved my life.\n\nOn the 13th of March I worked my last shift due to COVID-19. that week i only worked 2 out my 4 shifts bc i was in a bad place mentally that week and i used my two days that i am allowed to use if i need a mental health day. I get two days a month that i can use to stay home if needed through my FMLA (family medical leave act) paperwork. So my check that week was only fir 2 days. Luckily the week before i got my yearly profit sharing check so i had a decent amount of cash at the time...so for the first 3 weeks of not working i had no money worries even though i didnt have any coming in. \n\nDuring the first 3 weeks of being laid off i have been in such a great place mentally. I have been painting, crafting, cleaning, organizing, reading, started a new skin care routine, writing, sleeping well and napping sometimes, cooking for myself and the family ( due to my work hours i can\u2019t due this generally)... i have been in a really great place mentally, and i know it\u2019s bc i have not had to work. However, due to all this i had to blow that money and I\u2019m getting really scared that i will not be able to move into my friends apartment in June when their roommate leaves as planned. Which is something that i REALLY need in order to prosper. Two days after valentines day last year my boyfriend of 3 years that i lived with woke up one morning and dumped me and kicked me out of our apt...three days after being added to my phone contract and getting new phones... and a week after i got in a terrible car accident totaling my 3 month old car and breaking my sternum...he was an asshole i guess, and i had to move back home, and buy a bed and a car... so this past year i have been rebuilding my life. \n\nSo yes, for the first 3 weeks i was in an amazing place mentally, bc i didnt have the stress of my job. Ive already been aware that i feel i only have 5-10 good years of working full time in me. My job is so exhausting and since I\u2019m on an assembly line it\u2019s all mindless, physical work that leave me trapped in my head for 12 hours straight. Plus the hour commute back and forth, i can\u2019t do anything but work, eat, sleep during my work week. I know I\u2019m only 30, but ive been working since i was 13, and have always worked very hard trying to get away from my toxic life. I have already feared that i mentally won\u2019t be able to handle full time for that much longer, and this real segmented that I\u2019m right. That work is too stressful at times for my mental health to be able to get up on time, get myself out of bed, get there on time and do the work. I can go a month without needing a break but if i have a bipolar episode i don\u2019t know when it comes, what to expect, or how long it will stay. I mean, i can be a feminist and know that at the end of the day i need extra care, and if i get married I\u2019m gonna need someone that understands that, and i can hopefully go to working part time only, and somewhere much easier, and that i may actually enjoy. \n\nSo now that my money is gone, and my unemployment still has yet to start coming in, i am starting to get really anxious. Also, i live bear chicago and northwest indiana, so the weather is really changing. When the weather starts getting nice, and i can smell it in the air, and it\u2019s sunny out, i get really really anxious. I don\u2019t know what it is, like reverse seasonal affective or perhaps my body remembering trauma. My first, clear, bipolar depressive phase started at age 22, at this time when the weather was changing for spring. It lasted til October and for the first time i understood how people could end their life. I was no stranger to depression, but this was different. For some reason i knew i would never be the same. Now, bc of that long bipolar episode i get super anxious at even the smell of nice weather. Not always, but it can be bad when it does.\n\nSo, i was in a really good place during this for weeks. The happiest i had been in a VERY VERY long time. But I\u2019m super anxious now....however, i think if my unemployment was coming in i would still be in a great place... i really do hope that you feel better. If you need to talk you can send me a PM, all i have is time... just know that you are not alone. We are a community.",

You could try dressing up in something more outrageous to stand out. It works for some people because even though people are seeing your outer appearance, they're not really seeing you.

Ask them how high they have ever been on the scale? It starts a conversation. \n\nYou might be surprised. Maybe your friends have struggled with this too. \n\nThis scale actually started as a really dark game to get our friend to talk about her suicidal thoughts.

There's obviously a parallel with unipolar depression, but there are parallels with schizophrenia and ADHD as well. \"Full blown\" manic episodes with psychotic features can look like schizophrenia. The racing thoughts in (hypo)manic / mixed states lead to problems with concentration and focus, similar to ADHD inattentive type.

        "Yeah man.  Idk if it just feels easier for some (and is actually jeopardising their recovery) or if it actually benefits some, but my mental health is taking a hit.\n\nUni moved online, now can't keep up with material and assessments, nor can I work sitting in the same place all day in my room, so I just dropped all the subjects (real shame because this was the first in like 4 semesters I was actually making progress and looking to sit some exams), the gym closed so all those goals are kinda fucked - fitness also because I can't really run too regularly because of my feet - and the mental health benefits of doing shit has gone, I don't get outside enough and in general am just flattening quite a bit.\n\nThing is it's not wasted time.  In times where you can't do things, improve, expose yourself to new experiences, maintain some of your hobbies, exercise fully or even work, you can always practice mindfulness - in fact this is the best time to do so.\n\nIt's important just to keep a few good habits going:\n\nBrushing your teeth/ washing daily\n\nEating regularly and focus on nutrition (try to get enough healthy fats, proteins, vitamins, fibre, antioxidants in your day and avoid processed sugars and saturated fats - especially as being in quarantine, these sugars and sat fats just weaken your tolerance to life).  Maybe you can even hit a caloric defecit and lose some fat if you want, although not recommended for weight trainers who want to maintain muscle mass.\n\nExercising - go for a run, do some pushups every 2nd hour, some Turkish getups maybe, single leg squats etc. This really revolutionizes your mindset for days even after one thing (one set of pushups at max reps at the start of the day can make the difference between a good day and a shit one).\n\nOutside - go for a walk or sit in the sun for any amount of time.  This does a similar thing as exercising.\n\nAny discipline - people don't like doing nothing.  We like to think we like doing nothing so that we trick ourselves into being motivated to do things with the promise of respite afterwards, but we only like recovering from hard work, not doing nothing.  For this reason, it is much more beneficial to read stimulating material, learn things in depth or generally improve at things - vegetating on the couch watching netflix or gaming (not all gaming ofc) will just lower your resilience and generally decrease your sense of purpose.\n\nInstead, try to find something you want to do, or have been meaning to do but been putting off, and focus all other energy on that.  Of course if you have just about any solid responsibility in this time, most of your resources will probably will be preoccupied with dealing with that.  If you have few commitments though, finding something productive is a great way to make use of your time.\n\nFor me, I've been meaning to read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Solzhenitsyn for a while - maybe I'll read war and piece.  I've been reading Aurelius, and have been wanting to read up on Epictetus.  Similarly I've been practicing my trumpet improv which needs a lot of work, and bettering my poker game.  I still have a few things to do with uni (study some prerequesites but also just general academic interests) so I've been doing that too.\n\nThese probably won't apply to you, but the point is if I do all of these (in order), it becomes a lot harder to have a bad day.  If I have a bad day, it's normally because I have failed to do one of the things, and really that is just a lack of discipline.",

        "It's really great! Love it! For me, getting over that feeling of inadequaecy and anxiety when feeling judged by others is practically insurmountable.... sometimes. Other times, as soon as that self-defeating talk creeps up, I have to slooooooowwwwww dooooooowwwwwnnn tiiiiiiimeeee and get mindful, stop the thought, grab it gently, pet it like a little puppy and get all CURIOUS with it. That's what you do, you do not allow yourself a reaction, you give yourself SPACE, get that \"they think I'm ugly and poor\" (I dunno that's what I always think) and say, \"Why do you feel this way? Hey, YOU are not ugly and poor. Well, you are pretty poor, and one time a cow fainted when it turned around and saw you, but it's okay. This person? They are just another person, and you are writing a narrative that they think you are ugly and poor.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe comic just spoke to me so deeply, because I remember years ago being at that spot where every encounter filled me with fear and loss of safety and discomfort. I thought they were all looking at me. They would look at my teeth, or my fat, or my loose arm skin, shit, I dunno! But you do find peace in making space to get curious and gentle with your thoughts, and you can simply acknowledge the thoughts, and like Marie Kondo, wish the shitty thought well, and send it off into the ether. Try it! The next time a self-deprecating thought pops up and you are out in public and you are starting to feel a panic attack brewing, stop everything, take a moment to do your breathing and while you focus on your breath try to track down a couple of the negative thoughts that are driving your reaction to your environment. It's amazing how mindfulness CAN absolutely work wonders. How long has it taken me?\n\nI was in therapy LONG BEFORE I made this account.

The human brain is literally 95-99% unconsciously driven. Everyone deserves to be loved and appreciated and if people don\u2019t it\u2019s not because you chose incorrectly. We really overemphasize the role of personal choice. Think about what I said earlier once again. 95-99% of the human brain is completely unconscious. That means it\u2019s inaccessible consciously. That means consciousness is literally like what it feels like to be you. It\u2019s not you. There is no \u201cyou\u201d in your own damn head. The concept of \u201cself\u201d is an illusion. Your brain is like a committee and it makes literally almost all of its decisions without your conscious awareness. Mental health is a societal problem. It\u2019s a social problem. It\u2019s a cultural problem. It\u2019s NOT an individual problem. People are mentally ill because they have unmet needs and unprocessed trauma and they are surrounded by people who abuse them",

The good thing about seeking help as an adult is that no one gets to tell me what the reality is, I can choose who I see and always have the freedom to leave if I choose to, and I want to be there for myself. I know a few of the specifics in case we get into sensitive topics too, (such as having suicidal ideation or passive thoughts versus admitting to a detailed plan with intent) knowing what I can and cannot say without repercussions is helpful.",

When I told him this via email, asking for any suggestions, he responded with \"ok thanks\". \n\nNow I realize that I shouldn't expect a paid professional to do anything for free, but you would think the human side of someone would poke through a little bit with some advice or well wishes. Or you know, at least make it look like you actually read past the part where I said I couldn't afford him. But yeah, that response made me realize he didnt care about me past my co pay.

        "I completely disagree. It is actually the lack of arrogance what makes scientific advances so slow. Everything must be tested and replicated repeatedly to ensure there is no error, before it is established as reliable and new research can be built on top of it.\n\nYou can actually see it when paradigm shifts ocur. The paradigm shift is actually made, usually in a relatively small institution, very quickly, but is not even shared to others until several tests mark it as viable. Once shared all new institutions have to replicate whatever experiments have been done to corroborate to accept this shift, which is why the shift takes very long to spread. If you look into it, you'll see many radical shits were actually made in the 80's, and we just now getting to hear them, for this reason.\n\nArrogance would be what the alternative \"medicine\" practicioners do: insist they've got it right, everyone else had it wrong, and go with it demanding acceptance even in the absences of throough evidence. Alternative \"medicine\" advances pretty quickly in contrast to regular medicine for this reason: see how long it took us to get from \"Maybe the body affects the mind too\" to \"Cancer is caused by your thoughts and through my 'psychotherapy' I can cure cancer\" (BioNeuroEmoci\u00f3n or Bioneuroemotion or whatever), or how fast we went from \"Family relations reliably affect the mental health of the individuals of the family\" (Systemic family therapy, which is legit) to \"You are conected to your ancestors and your depression is caused by the spiritually transmited trauma your great-great grandmother had a hundred years ago\" (Hellinger's nonesence) precicely because while the institute of Millan was thorough in its testing and humble to say \"We think, but we're not sure it is true yet\" and took its time, Bert Hellinger just declared his method was a breakthrough and started giving seminars everywhere.\n\nFreud is another example. He didn't really test his ideas. He falsified evidence and ignored evidence that his theories didn't work, or outright hid it to preserve his image. His ideas were impresive (even if not accurate) and he right away went to declare it truth and go on teaching. Sadly psychoanalists everwhere today still hang on to those nonesensical ideas and just won't let go, despite both evidence that Freud was wrong and theories about the mind that explain it way better than Freud's ever did. But there's nothing more arrogant than a psychoanalist, so don't expect them to let go soon.\n\nScience moves at the speed of stone, but its results are solid.",

This leads to emotional reactions that can be dramatically out of proportion to minor positive or negative events. Other ways it often presents are very rapid transitions back and forth between intensely positive and intensely negative emotions and love/hate relationships with other people.

Be proud of the person you are and the things you achieved inspite all the mental issues you had to go trough. Just exist in the moment, focus on becoming your better self and start geniunely  enjoying life. Let go of expectations. Don't compare yourself to others ( easier said than done, but it CAN be done ). Forget all of the time you've lost, it doesn't exist anymore, it's not real, it doesn't matter.

Every time she would ask if there was anything that I wanted to talk about, I could never seem to muster up the courage to bring it up, and would just continue to suffer in silence.\n\n This past week I could feel my emotions coming to a head, and I was close to having a breakdown. However, I held it together and made it to my session. About 5 minutes in, my T asked if there was anything on my mind. I completely broke down and everything came spilling out; the suicidal thoughts, the severe anxiety, and how I had reached my limit. I was crying hysterically and could not not catch my breath or control myself. My T stared at me in silence for about a minute and then asked if she could sit next to me. She sat right by me, took both of my hands, and I realized she had tears in her eyes. She began to cry, and apologized for not realizing the severity of my depression and expressed sympathy for my pain. We were able to discuss a plan that would involve my doctor and psychiatrist getting involved. She assured me that she would be there to help me work through this, and I promised to be more honest with her. \n\nI have never had a session that felt more healing than this one. Experiencing such raw emotion (on both sides) and seeing that my T genuinely cares about me is a huge step in our work. I hope that this will be one of many steps. \n\nTLDR: Finally told my T about severe depression and suicidal thoughts. She cried with me, and it was a huge step in my healing",

        "Hey! I'm sorry you had to go through that!   \n\n\nThe one person that has it better is you, because that person isn't in your life anymore! People that don't deserve to be in your life will not be in your life. It's their loss, it's because of their choices.   \n\n\nI'm going to tell you a story.  There was this person that I considered a good friend in college. He tried scamming me with those pyramid schemes, I didn't get scammed. I was really really nice to him in college, and even till the point he tried scamming me. When I was approached, I figured I'd check it out, and I was just going to talk and find out what's up. When I told my brother and my parents, they said it sounded fishy, and although I thought it was like that as well, as the guys I spoke to seemed that way, I thought the person I considered my friend would never do that to me. I gave him every single benefit of the doubt, and he had lied to me to my face. I did some research and found out which company they were from, and I found out that it was a scam. I felt really bad that he did that that time, and I vented to my friends for 3 days. But I'm extremely grateful that it happened because I genuinely cared about him till that point, and I found out he was unworthy of friendship and loyalty. Friendship and loyalty are extremely important to me! The universe was helping me see that person's true colors, and I'm happy that everything that's ever happened to me happened to me, you know? Everything that's happened makes me who I am.  \n\n\nYou're perfect the way you are! We should always accept ourselves for who we are. If there's something you don't like about yourself, you can change it, but only for yourself, not for others. Others should accept you for who you are! You should accept others for who they are as well! :) Always be okay with seeing a person's true colors, good or bad! :) Whoever is meant to stay in your life will, and whoever isn't will not! :)  \n\n\nAs for what you're going through, when things are hard, we grow! Perhaps what we're meant to do, we will do better with what we learn from the times we're suffering! Perhaps you're meant to start a company, and you think of an idea because you're going through this.  \n\n\nLet me tell you something, each and every single vibration influences the course of the timeline. Even if one single thing was different, we wouldn't be here! So perhaps, this was meant to happen so that you'd meet a special someone that you're meant to be with! You never know! We're not supposed to know everything beforehand! What's meant to happen will happen! :) What we can do, is be ourselves, and have the right intentions from our side! :)   \n\n\nKarma is a teacher! The universe will make sure they understand that it wasn't okay to do what they did! :)  \n\n\nYou have a purpose, and that purpose is fulfilled by you being yourself! :) You're one in seven billion! You're perfect the way you are! :)  \n\n\nYou said that you were suicidal. I'm here if you ever need someone to talk to! :) I want to say is, life's about being happy. If you're depressed, I really think you should take a break, and try to connect to yourself. Try to understand why you feel what you feel! Try to understand what you want from life! Connect to yourself! It might be scary at first, but just because it's hard and scary doesn't mean it's bad, you know? It's like untying a knot! Talk to your mind! :)\n\nIf your job is toxic to you, you should quit! You're allowed to not want to be near people that affect you negatively! You're allowed to not do things you don't like! To eventually become happy, it's about getting into a neutral state of mind! Once you reach that, you'll be able to get to a state where you're happy all the time!\n\nEmotions are very important, and it's important to not suppress them, or avoid them! They can exhaust you, and be a weight on your chest as well! It's important to stay connected to them! Your heart doesn't lie to you! :) Listen to it! :)\n\nLife's about being happy, and doing what you love! Life's about having fun, and spending time with your loved ones! Life's about finding out what you're passionate about, and doing it! You're one in seven billion! You're perfect the way you are! Everyone's great at something, and everyone can be great at something if they do what it takes! Everyone is a genius in their own way! If you haven't found out what you're passionate about, keep looking! Here's the thing, people love watching passionate people do their thing! Whether it's streaming games, or singing, or whatever! Do something you want to do in life! Follow your passion! Follow your heart! If you do what you're passionate about, everyday, when you wake up, you'll embrace the day instead of going \"Ugh, I have to work today\", you know? It might not be sunshine and rainbows all the time, but it's something you want!\n\nLife is like a marathon! It's about the journey, and not the destination! You run for yourself, you run with your friends and family, and eventually, you'll find someone that you want to run the rest of your life with! ;) Do what you want to do! :)  \n\n\nIt's important to understand that there are things out of our control, and one shouldn't worry about things that we can't do anything about! What we do have control over, we can do something, so we shouldn't worry as much! :)\n\nI really wish this helped! :) I am your friend! I'm here if you need someone to talk to! :) Take care! :)",

        "Man good news!\n\nI just want to say one thing that has opened my eyes a lot, and may be interesting.\n\nFirstly, as intelligent, self-aware beings, it only makes sense to me that suicide should be a natural choice.  It appears to me that our right to death is as important, if not even more so, than our right to life.  I think in almost all cases, the decision to die is often made hastily and out of temporary emotional distress, and is (as you point out here) most likely a mistake.\n\nI say this just because I think the subject should be approached differently than it is in society today.  It is not wrong to kill yourself, but it is also not any better than just simply being.  I think it is something I may have heard from Alan Watts in his lectures on zen that the spirit world/ death just isn't viewed as any different from life.  Anyway, the last thing I want to say leads on from this which is that living in the present moment is a retreat.  Practising mindfulness, breathing, is something that has been revolutionary to me.  It really helps gain a third-person perspective on your life and realise that your emotions are just emotions - they guide you, but they *are not* you.  Listening to guys like Thich Naht Hanh on his monestary's youtube channel Plum Village has been really useful for me this past year.\n\nPersonally I got off antidepressants around a year ago because they seemed to make it worse, and being more mindful and physically active seemed to work for me, but if that's what works for you then keep it up.  Just know there are more options, and more routes to health.  Life's an ongoing, individual experience.  Your psychiatrist doesn't have all the answers either, only their own.  It took me a while to realise the best solution for me was to leave (medicated) psychiatry, it just wasn't an effective tool.",

I woke up at 9AM too, without an alarm! I'm still really tired because of school, and I'm struggling to focus, but like. I'm doing my best. And that's really all I can be doing. \n\nIt doesn't help the discomfort I feel sometimes with still be alone at 20, or the sweet whispered nothings when I play Overwatch and wanna just leave mid game because \"it doesn't matter, nothing really matters\". And it doesn't help the deep loneliness I feel because of isolation, or that it's going to fall off a cliff in the coming weeks as my semester ends and I don't even get on Zoom class anymore. \n\nBut my little morning routine doesn't need to help those things.

You can see I linked several, and to be honest I didn't spend hours reading each one because it seems like you're just in it to argue and it's past 11PM here.

        "Thing is I\u2019m not physically addicted to a single substance. I\u2019m mentally addicted to not being sober. I\u2019ve done so many different drugs because I get bored quickly and my tolerance builds up to fast for it to be cost effective. Whenever I do anything the first thing I think is, I wish I was high rn. Whenever I go out to a restaurant, I\u2019ll smoke weed cos it\u2019s better. Whenever I party, I\u2019ll drink till I drop and then pop pingerz or do blow till I wake back up. I\u2019ve tried separating myself from drugs and it\u2019s all I think about. Even when I try to quit I\u2019ll end up drinking the smoking because everything is just better. In my experience there\u2019s literally a drug for every occasion. In my GCSE art exams I did ecstasy. If I\u2019m doing a presentation for class I\u2019ll take like half a xan and a couple shots then maybe also take ecstasy to perk up my energy levels. I can feel my body dying and I\u2019m only 18. I get headaches nearly everyday even when I\u2019ve been sober for a week I\u2019ll get mild stomach cramps all the time. Mentally I feel like I\u2019ve done as much damage as you can possibly do from drugs. My serotonin is long gone from multiple week long binges of ecstasy. I have HPPD from whatever idek probably 2cb. I have psychosis from chronic abuse of weed and stimulants. Luckily I\u2019m scared of heroin and shit cos I\u2019ve watched too many documentaries but I\u2019d be lying if I said I haven\u2019t considered it. There\u2019s just no point whatever I do I\u2019ll never be satisfied. Yeah I\u2019ve travelled but I can\u2019t do that anymore because I\u2019ll just get bored from not being able to get high. Plus because of my PTSD and anxiety I don\u2019t feel safe anywhere but in my room. I get anxiety when my parents speak to me so leaving the house makes me feel sick on a daily basis unless I smoke weed. I have even started carrying knives and stuff because I\u2019m afraid for my life when I leave the house. So not only am I paranoid of normal people but I\u2019m paranoid of teachers and police. I don\u2019t trust a single person not even my girlfriend. I was convinced that my best friend was trying to steal from me and I was convinced my other friend was trying to manipulate me and control my mind. I can\u2019t handle shit anymore. There\u2019s honestly no alternative. My doctor might prescribe diazepam for my anxiety and I\u2019ll just abuse that until I run out and I\u2019ll be back to where I was in a couple days. There\u2019s honestly no hope for me anymore. Whatever I do everything will continue to get worse. I\u2019m slowly losing everything I\u2019ve ever loved. 5 members of my family have died in the last four years. My family is barely scraping through financially. I\u2019ve been kicked out of 3 high schools and now I\u2019m in college and I\u2019m about to be kicked out again. I\u2019ve got no friends because I don\u2019t trust anyone. My dad doesn\u2019t give a fuck about me. My mums too depressed in herself to even recognise that fact that I\u2019m slowly killing myself. I regularly go months without speaking to my brother because I have no relationship with any of my family anymore because they sent me of to boarding school at a young age where I was beaten up, bullied and abused all the time for three years. Honestly there\u2019s one person in the whole world that gives a fuck about me and that\u2019s my girlfriend but I don\u2019t really love her like that anymore but I\u2019m just scared to break up with her because her Dad just died a month ago and I want to be there for her but the stress of keeping up a relationship that I don\u2019t even think I want to be in for nearly a year is making me go insane. I don\u2019t even know what I want anymore I just need it all to stop and the only things that have ever worked were drugs and now they\u2019re making everything worse. My only life aspiration is to become famous and rich so I can do more drugs and buy pointless shit but I know that won\u2019t happen and even if it does I\u2019m still gonna kill myself anyway because really there\u2019s no point in life. I\u2019m not special I\u2019ll never have an impact on anyone\u2019s life for the better. I\u2019m so unmotivated to do anything and whenever something bad happens the first thing I think is \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter anyway cos I can just kill myself\u201d. I\u2019ve tried to get better I really have. I quit drugs for like six months but I was still depressed. If I\u2019m like this now at the age of 18 imagine the state I\u2019ll be in, in a couple years. I\u2019ll be homeless and then I\u2019ll just kill myself. I may as well just end it now. Weird thing is I don\u2019t even feel sad anymore. I used to. But now I have realised that the only real option I have is to kill myself. At least then I get to choose how much pain I go through.\n\nThanks for speaking to me. Felt really good to actually talk to someone. You\u2019re a nice person. You deserve a good life. Be happy.",

        "> We simply can't measure mental health the same way that we measure other  issues, and have to work with what we have, which is anecdotal  evidence. \n\nNo, we do not need to accept anecdotal evidence as the standard of care. It's pervasive *because* people accept it. There is low-quality evidence for efficacy--no one loses by simply admitting this is the case and operating from this position. However, this is rarely communicated to patients. Instead, we are often blamed.\n\n This is especially salient given the original post and what you mentioned about \"finding the right therapist.\" It is not the patient's fault and placing the impetus on the \"right fit\" belies the underlying issue with efficacy. Stop blaming the patient for issues with the treatment--none of us need the additional guilt of thinking we fucked up our own treatment or didn't try hard enough or couldn't find the \"right therapist.\"\n\nAs you mentioned, a treatment will work if administered by a shitty physician or a fantastic physician. We should not perpetuate the mythos of patient blaming for not correctly \"jiving\" with their therapist to elicit a treatment response. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> When problems are not black and white, like math, there is no correct answer. \n\nHumans deserve evidenced-based medicine. I would never look a patient in the face and tell them, \"Sorry, your chemo didn't work because your relationship with your oncologist just wasn't the right fit.\" \n\nWe do not accept this behavior in oncology and we should not accept this excuse in mental health. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> See above for why we HAVE TO have lower standards and expectations. The alternative is no care. \n\nThe alternative is to stop perpetuating patient blame and recognize the lack of efficacy while advocating for evidence-based medicine.",
