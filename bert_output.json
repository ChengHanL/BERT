        "9": "On a rainy March day, 4 years ago, my parents were out of town and I had a full-fledged suicide plan in place. I turned my phone off, I had filled my dog\u2019s food and water bowls, I had my note printed out, and I sat solemnly in the silence of my home, enjoying what I believed was my final meal- a bowl of Kraft Mac n Cheese. \n\nYou see, I was a freshman in college, and had gotten raped by a man I had recently met. When I attempted to speak out against what happened to me, I was immediately labeled a whore. Anything I said was discredited by him and his friends, since I had freely chosen to go and see him at night. Besides, he was a Marine. His reputation was impeccable. People with so much to lose don\u2019t do things like that, right?\n\nAfter multiple attempts to tell my foreign parents that I was struggling mentally, and with all of those attempts being minimized to \u201cdepression is for the weak\u201d, I had had enough.\n\nHalfway through my Mac n Cheese, I heard a knock at my front door. Strange, since it was a Friday night and I was not expecting company. I decided to answer the door anyways. \n\nIt was a guy I had went to high school with. I did not consider him a friend, but he knew where I lived because we were partners for a high school group project years prior. He kept in touch after high school because during the time we spent working on our group project, he had discovered my closeted obsession for Pok\u00e9mon. He would occasionally send me interesting updates about the game. Despite this, I overlooked him and admittedly never really thought much about his presence in my life. \n\nI was, obviously, very confused why he had showed up to my house, unannounced. He reached into his pocket and handed me a pack of unopened Pok\u00e9mon cards. He said that he had been at the store, and remembered that we had briefly discussed a particular card set a few weeks prior, so he decided to buy it for me. He said that he had texted, asking if he could come drop it off, but that his message was not delivering. Since my house was on the route back to his, he decided to stop by to drop it off. It was a nice gesture, but in that moment, I could not have cared less. As I thanked him and went to close the door, he asked if I wanted to go for a drive. I said no thanks, and that I had other things planned for the night. He was never a pushy guy, but he insisted that I joined him. I sighed, and grabbed my jacket. \n\nHe aimlessly drove me around. We sat in absolute silence for hours, besides him occasionally asking if the temperature in his car was okay and if it was okay if he stopped for gas. I was confused on what we were doing. A part of me was afraid that he was working up the nerve to do what the Marine had done to me months prior. Another piece of me was terrified at the fact that I was too drained, my spirit so broken, to even care if he did. \n\nBut he didn\u2019t.\n\nHe drove. He drove until his tank was nearing empty. He went and filled his tank. And then, he kept driving. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t question it, but I guess I was just so relieved that my plans for the night had changed. In that moment, I knew that I, in fact, did not want to kill myself. When my mind came to that realization, I began sobbing hysterically. Would you believe me if I said that he simply kept on driving? He kept driving until I began to doze off. When he noticed, he took me home. As I was exiting his car, he said to me, \u201cAnything else planned for tonight?\u201d I shook my head no. He nodded, and thought for a moment, before saying, \u201cText me tomorrow to let me know how you liked the cards.\u201d I nodded and went inside. I took the suicide note I had sitting on the coffee table, and put it into my dad\u2019s shredder in his home office. I took the Pok\u00e9mon cards out of my pocket, and placed them in the place the note had been. I told myself that I would wait to open them the next morning. Because for the first time, in a very long time, there was a \u201cnext morning\u201d to look forward to. \n\n\nFrom that day on, Kraft Mac n Cheese became a food I would eat whenever I was feeling particularly low. Rather than it being a last meal of sorts, it now serves as a source of comfort- a reminder that there are always mini sources of joy in this world, whether that be a bowl of Mac n Cheese, or a pack of Pok\u00e9mon cards.",

They were fighting on the front porch while I was in the kitchen making a bottle for my 8 mo son who was sleeping in his crib on the other side of the house. After they were arguing, my dad walked in to the house, shut his bedroom door and shot himself in the head. I was right outside the door when it happened and I can\u2019t get the sound out of my head. Luckily, my son slept through the whole thing and was quickly taken out of the house by his father while I called 911.

I know it\u2019s strange to post something so personal to random people but hearing from all of you makes me feel less alone, I guess. I 100% agree about therapy and I am definitely no stranger to it and the help it gives.

I was overwhelmed in life and saw no way out aside from ending it all.

Lived in some slummy apartments with no AC and barely had any grocery money. I usually bummed pizza from local Pizza shops at the end of the night when someone hadn\u2019t picked up a carry out order. Sometimes I\u2019d get something, sometimes I\u2019d get told to fuck off. Got on average 3 hours of sleep aside from Saturday nights. Mental health was at an all time low.\n\nI made some changes that started with therapy.

He propped me up and undressed, then dressed me while my eyes swelled up. He didn\u2019t even ask. He just did it. Every time I think about that moment I tear up because it was the most intimate and sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am so lucky to have such a caring man in my life. I can\u2019t wait to marry him some day. Our relationship is him doing the most selfless acts of love for me, and even though he might not think much of his actions, they mean the world to me. And for an update on my mental, I am doing incredibly better. Don\u2019t want to go too in depth because he deserves all the love on this post. Thank you for reading. \u2665\ufe0f",

        "85": "My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. \n\nI'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she \"succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19\" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to \"heaven\" and not \"hell\" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed \"sin\". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.\n\nI posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying \"Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not.\" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. \n\nThey fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. \n\nI'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the \"eyes of God\". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.\n\nI feel so bad for her. If her parents made \\*me\\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.\n\nJust needed to vent, thanks for reading.",

They have ruined dinners out, caused friction in relationships, and generally made my life stressful since the day he decided to run for office by talking about him constantly, aggressively, and refusing to listen to what anyone else has to say. This is not on me or for lack of trying to understand their POV.\n\nI really don't think I'm exaggerating or being rude to state that this is cult-like behavior.

This is my favorite kind of post to see\u2014anywhere!\nI work in inpatient mental health and it might sound weird, but I LOVE when I have the chance to work with \u201cyounger\u201d patients\u2014like 35 and under\u2014because they tend to be the group that has the best likelihood of a good outcome. It\u2019s the group that usually has the strongest support system, the most resilience, and most importantly, deep down, the most hope for the future...which is how you end up with a post like this. \n\nIt\u2019s so great to see that even though things haven\u2019t come easily to you that you didn\u2019t give up and you fought through the roughest moments and that you accomplished such an amazing goal. And it\u2019s admirable that you took the steps to care for yourself when you were in crisis\u2014*at least* 8 times (wowza, x8!)\u2014and to do what you needed to to get back on your feet. I know you know that this doesn\u2019t mean the hard times are over and that there will be periods in your life where things get hard again. And I hope that you remember in the back of your mind that you\u2019ve made it back over and over and no matter how difficult it might seem in that moment, that you have it in you to make it back again\u2014and *again* and *again* if it comes down to that. You\u2019re strong and smart and clearly a fighter. Don\u2019t forget those things and don\u2019t forget this moment. \n\nKeep building your support system while you\u2019re in this good place and keep utilizing the resources that have worked for you in a preventative way, to *keep* yourself as healthy as possible. Know and remember the signs of a relapse and don\u2019t be afraid to get help again at the first sign of trouble. Strong people don\u2019t *not* need help\u2014strong people reach for it at the first sign of needing it. Strong people use what they\u2019ve learned to help themselves and rally for themselves and to *stay* strong and brave even when that means taking breaks to care for themselves or having moments/days/weeks/months/years of struggle. \nSpeaking out about what you\u2019ve been through is so admirable and it\u2019ll surely mean a lot to other people who are struggling and who think they\u2019ll never be able to fight their mental health issues enough to reach their own goals. Being honest like this will help you stay accountable with yourself and your mental health and will bring you an even larger support system. You have it in you to make such a positive impact on your own life *and* the lives of others. I hope you continue to speak out and to maybe even get involved with some mental health organizations/groups to spread your positivity/encouragement and be around like-minded, mental health stigma-breakers like yourself.\nYou have what it takes to fight this and to keep triumphing over it. I wish you the very best! Congrats and keep kicking ass! :)",

I haven\u2019t fully integrated into society yet as a working member, but I think with patience and support independence is a great possibility.  Thank you for your above and beyond kind words.  I am happy for your peace.",

After my third It clicked that I needed meds for life and with the loving support of my family I got back in school and stuck with it. Thankyou",
        "292": "Thank you! Good parents are often the unsung heroes of mental health recovery and I can tell your really empathetic to your sons care.  It\u2019s hard on those afflicted with the illness but having a family dynamic punctuated with hospitalizations of a loved one is no picnic either.  Treatment for mental illness is initially trial and error and it can be heartbreaking and dysfunctional when the doctors don\u2019t get it right.  It can go both ways with over medication and under medication so self advocacy is very important from the patient, and I can imagine this is can be harder to navigate with a child.  I think most kids hate school around that age, although I acknowledge his challenges.  There is light at the end of the tunnel and I totally believe your son will do just fine with support along the way.  He sounds like an interesting guy.  Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb ",

I went to community college and a state university where I picked up significant Pell grants along the way.

The big game changer for me was getting on injections (risperdal at first then invega) . I\u2019m not a doctor, but these drugs put me in remission which was a godsend.  Before this I also dropped out of one community college and I was asked to leave from another for unstable behavior.

But  I did run into some issues with stress around finals where I became really agitated and showed some poor social etiquette to my classmate friends.  I sort of unconsciously put a poor girl in a therapist position by my text bombing/ venting.  I\u2019m definitely doing a lot better now that I have not one therapist but two.  My mom is a yoga practitioner and I have read a John Kabot Zinn book/ been a part of a meditation group, but my meditation practice has been sporadic.  It does relieve existential angst, anxiety/dread for me, so I usually meditate when I am suffering with slight depression or anxiety.  I made the mistake of trying to combat my schizoaffective solely by meditation/without meds when I first was diagnosed, but it inevitably lead to psychosis.",

The associates degree was more of a slog finding out where my talents were with general ed courses, but when I relapsed I thought of how an associates degree would remove my dropping out of high school from the conversation.  Transferring to a state university where I got to pick my major was very gratifying; when I relapsed it helped that I had a lot of passion for the program and enjoyed getting back into the classroom as a social outlet/way to express myself.  The associates degree was more that I had something to prove, but when I continued with my bachelors in English I found constantly reading literature and discussing it with peers/writing to be very therapeutic.",

If I recall glutamate let\u2019s the brain communicate within all its parts and they found a higher level of glutamate receptors in people with schizophrenia.  This over communication could excite other neurotransmitter leading to illness.  The new drug is supposed to improve negative symptoms related to basic functioning rather than positive symptoms like delusion ,hallucinations,etc....in the mean time I tried the cheap supplement theanine which is a natural glutamate blocker from green tea in most grocery stores.  I felt really good immediately after taking it.  It has a calming anti anxiety effect and has good synergy with caffeine.  I believe it naturally promotes gaba while blocking glutamate.  I havnt fact checked this, and it would be better to take a doctors word than mine, but it did somewhat improve my quality of life/ maybe your son would benefit.",

I don't understand this reaction but I could spend all day talking to cashiers, I'm sure it freaks out the other people waiting behind me but everybody gets my attention there so it hasn't caused too many problems for me.  \n\nI'm guessing that cashiers get wound-up with the urge to stop the constant flow of non-intimate interaction and I suspect that tension is what triggers my otherwise restrained personality to bloom.  Of course, I've met more than a couple cashiers who respond negatively to me but most of them seem to enjoy the extra attention or at least find me amusing.\n\nYeah, I've also had some life-changing experiences in grocery stores, it's a primal zone in my experience.",

When some mental illnesses are actually more painful than some physical illnesses. It should just be treated equally and taken as seriously, every day.

Secondly, shame on you for spewing your shit ass opinion on such a sensitive subject with clearly very little understanding of the reality of it. Mental illnesses are not treated the same as physical illnesses. They're are people I personally know who don't even think mental illnesses are a real thing. They think it's just made up in the persons head or \"that's just the way they are\". Mental healthcare has always and still is failing to really make a difference. They don't even necessarily know why certain mental illnesses occur still. And finding a good psychiatrist who actually does his job right and accurately diagnoses you and prescribes you the correct medication? Good fucking luck. It's a rotating door of money for the pharmaceutical companies. They aren't even sure what they should prescribe sometimes or what'll help. That's why there's so many different types of antipsychotics and bullshit like that. My biggest personal challenge was finding someone I trusted to even properly diagnose me. One of the main causes of deaths and suicide in those with mental illnesses are misdiagnosis. No ones telling anyone what they should care about. We're just saying it should be taken as seriously as physical illness are all the time and not belittled by people like you.",

Growing up I never heard a single thing that was mental health positive or that it was a good idea to see a doctor if you're suffering like that. Instead, the attitude was that even for physical illnesses you should take pride in bearing through the pain and sucking it up. Preventative care wasn't a thing, it was seen as ridiculous to try treating something that wasn't a dire emergency (even if ignoring the problem led to a small problem growing into an expensive and hard to treat problem).\n\n\nFor God's sake, please see a damn therapist or psychiatrist if you're suffering. I needlessly wasted years of my life because of this attitude towards medicine. About privacy - there's no such database that employers can look to see if you are diagnosed. Your medical privacy is considered a very serious thing by the HIPAA. Your friends and employer won't know unless you disclose it yourself. If you're worried about the money - consider how much your income is affected by being too mentally ill to be stably employed or too depressed to apply for a better job or education. Wouldn't your income increase if your mental illness was under control, and wouldn't that offset the cost of doctor appointments and pills?\n\n\nWhile asking a friend what you can do to help them is a good idea I have one caveat. I _dont_ recommend telling people that you will be there to listen to them. True support is encouraging them to start or continue care with professionals, not trying to become their pseudo-therapist. That's more like enabling than helping, and bad experiences can lead them to mistakenly believe that an actual therapist would be as uselessly unhelpful as an unqualified layperson. Similarly, don't give advice about pills other than the minimum \"have you told your psychiatrist about what you're telling/asking me?\"",

I remember my psychiatrist, when I told him I thought of suicide a lot, he asked me if I had a plan-do I have whatever I plan to use, have I set a date, etc? As low as I felt, he said it wasn\u2019t bad enough to \u201c send me up the hill\u201d to inpatient. Lately it\u2019s been bad tho, I said something to my dr at my last appt, she said it\u2019s just situational cuz my life sucks (my words, not hers), and didn\u2019t seem concerned. I\u2019d say I\u2019m usually between a 7 and a 9, and spend most days around an 8. I just worry about how it\u2019ll affect my nephew, as he\u2019s grown quite attached to me, and is old enough to remember me now.

Personally, I didn't have the energy or the ability to care enough to sort out my financial stuff, say goodbye or even write a note. If I had done it, I would've just done it. This is not to say that you have got it wrong - just that there are other perspectives.\n\n2) Secondly, I'd consider the potential problem of people looking at the scale and feeling bad or guilty because they are/were not as close to the actual act as other people. For example, I'm pretty far in my recovery, so I'm able to dismiss the thoughts, but I do still have a kneejerk reaction of 'I'm not as valid because I never made an actual attempt'.

We had sort of planned on that since we started illustrating the scale. \n\nI think it is also important to note, it is only a suicide scale, not an emotional pain scale. One does not need to be suicidal to be in pain or to need help. We are pretty miserable. We have been miserable all week. We lost a friend. All our friends are miserable. It just sucks. But we are a 3. We are in a lot of emotional pain, but we are not suicidal. \n\nA person could be a 2 or a 3 on this scale and have other problems, such as depression, anxiety, ptsd, did... that they need help with. Just because one\u2019s brain does not reach for suicide as a weird sort of escape hatch does not mean they don\u2019t still need help.\n\nWe only made the suicide scale because we use it as a tool to keep ourselves and our best friend safe. It has been for us a tried and true stop gap for the dangerous times.  Our only regret is we did not share it sooner and more widely. \n\nWe will probably give ourselves a little time, then we will maybe give a general mental health comic a go. To further explain it, and maybe make more scales and resources for other sorts of mental health problems, a sort of mental health tool kit.  \n\nWe just felt like we had to do the suicide scale right away. Idk that\u2019s what we do with big emotions I guess. We make them into something. \n\nWe will take a break before we start that comic tho.

There is this odd thing in the universe how your friend showed up that night, and it saved you. When my daughter was 14, she was going through a rough patch. I was keeping a fairly close eye on her, but I had a weekly aerobics class after work. One evening, after I parked my car at the recreation center, something told me to go home immediately. Do not go to aerobics class, something\u2019s wrong. Get home now. I\u2019ve learned to trust my inner voice, so I drove home quickly, I checked on my daughter, and I didn\u2019t sleep all night. I kept watch over her. Next day, I still had that feeling so I called a psych doc friend of mine, and brought my daughter in for a consultation. Oh at the time my daughter was sure she hated me because the doc put her in the hospital. Turns out my daughter told me later on when she stopped hating me, that night she had made a noose and planned to hang herself in the tree. I cannot fathom what would have happened had I not listened to my inner voice. It\u2019s been over 10 years now. Daughter is better. There had been an online predator messing with her mind back then, and she had spun into a deep depression. We reported everything we could but I think he got away with it.",

It could be that he's just very empathetic, or he may have noticed subtle shifts in OP -- slower response times to texts or noticeably altered syntax, or if he saw her a few times between when she was assaulted and that night perhaps there was something in her expression. Whatever the case, when she didn't respond to his texts his instinct was check on her, and because he cares about her when she opened the door he saw that she was in distress, so he did what he could: he offered her his time with no conditions upon it, to talk or just be with someone until she was okay.

Giving an outlet to the thoughts might make you feel relieved. Also, listening to instrumental music, lighting some aromatic candle and following the grounding exercise may help you to get back to a healthy routine.  one step at a time. you could also try to avoid social media mindfully before going to bed or avoiding a conversation that will go on for long hours or might lead to some stress may help you to get control over your sleep routine. If you have any doubts, feel free to reach out. take care.",

When your depressed its your body telling you that even though you are stuck something still needs to change, thats why depression is such an uncomfortable feeling.

        "1889": "Excellent question. I cant say for sure, but I will take a shot...  \n\n\nThe animal instinct, that is survival, has been around much longer than any desire to not survive. For example, lets look a anxiety. What is it, exactly? It is a response in the body to stress. If you see a predator coming after you, you either run  stand and fight, all this has become part of instinct.  We no longer have to worry much  about predators, as we once did. However, we still have that instinct. Why is this? Because it helped us to survive long ago, evolution left us with it.    \n\n\n  \nThe mental health crisis we have today is nothing new, its something which we have a difficult time understanding.  We lived a great deal longer in small tribes, worrying about basic survival, than we have as we live today. Think of it in terms of a computer, or any machinery which uses programming. We have the same hardware, as well as software, yet we live in a much different world. Also consider that we live now in the \"information age\". Human beings are processing maniacs; we suck in billions of bits of data every second, most of which subconsciously.   \n\n\nThe tl;dr version is that we are an ancient species which descends from survivors. Our ancestors fought like hell to survive, and we, today, are not much different. Only, again, we have these stresses which work against us.   \n\n\nI hope that explains a bit of what you asked. I could go into greater detail. It is good to research this type of thing, because, well, understanding human nature is a great survival tool, like a guide book. We are an old species, but we are still infants when it comes to understanding who we are and how we work. Consider that we have been in our current form for approx 250,000 years. Most of that time we spent just surviving. Today, how we live, tat is what I meant when I said we are like infants, we are just learning to understand who we are, and how to deal with our minds.",
        "1890": "I cannot say I agree with the idea of wanting to die. People hurt not to die, they hurt to live. The mental pain we feel is us fighting the urge to end it, think about that.",

        "1892": "It depends. But do it will you know what you are doing, not on impulse.",
        "1893": "I certainly agree with that. Rather well explained. I've heard the whole bit about anxiety just being a flight or fight response.",
        "1894": "Well yes, a few choose to do that instead of actually.. Kicking the bucket if you will.",
        "1895": "Wow that's Intense. And hit me harder that the other way of thinking,  yet I agree with both ideas. That's the hardest part of wanting to die and not wanting to live is being afraid of dying and equally afraid of living with either pain.",
        "1896": "True",
        "1897": "Well, thats geared more towards a panic attack, in my estimation. A panic attack, as you may well know, is generally not long lasting, but very terrifying.   \n\n\nEverything we go through is such cases may be a combination of many different things, such as past events/trauma, diet and exercise etc. Many people count out the last two, but what I think is, perhaps, some forget that we are a very complex system, and everything works in conjunction with one another.  If one of these are out of whack, its safe to assume the entire system is going to be effected in some way.  But even if one gets a work out every now and again, eats properly, gets plenty of sun (vitamin d), things can still go wrong.  \n\n\nWe have, what, 250 billion or so neurons in our brains, and 10,000 or so connections between each neuron? Taking that into consideration, its easy to see that something is going to go wrong eventually.",
        "1898": "Sure, that happens. My point was that they do fight. But sometimes the desire to live is outweighed by the desire to not suffer.  If one wishes to not hurt, they want to feel better. There is no possibility of relief if we are not here to experience.   \n\n\nWhen I went through it, I told myself that in order to feel good, I must be able to feel. It was never easy, not one day in over 4 years. All but , maybe 1, when I was manic for the first time. That is when I felt more alive than I ever have. Having experienced that manic state, I have come to realize, being manic, that it was simply my state of mind that caused me  to feel that good. It gave me hope when I was ready to end my life.   \n\n\nEveryone in my life looked down on me, it was extremely lonely. I am certain the total numbness I felt was my minds way of protecting itself/me.  Its sounds off, talking as if my brain and I were separate, but you get the idea.",
        "1899": "Nobody wants to die, as I said, we want to live. The urge to continue is instinct. If someone wanted to actually die, they would end it, period. It takes a tremendous amount of strength to not actually end it, and to endure the pain, we all understand that on some level.",
        "1900": "I weirdly enough do. I like the bit about having the mindset because I feel like that can set the tone for soo many things.

There are some incredibly helpful people in this sub (and in r/SuicideWatch) who will take a lot of time to listen and give some input. Personally I\u2019ve been through this enough times to know when I need professional help, when I need my friends to help me and also when I just need to express my thoughts to vent a bit, without upsetting anyone or making people worry. Sometimes I just want no-one from my real life involved, but instead just need to write stuff down and get some feedback to sort of get a grip of reality.\n\nBut of course, if you are in serious danger then Reddit is not much other than a place for immediate support. You should still talk to professionals.",

Nothing that I say will take away your pain, but I hope that we on Reddit can at least help you hold it for tonight. \n\nFirst, know that although you feel alone, in the dark, and under incredible pressure, know that you are never far from love and community. You are never alone. To share just one similar story: a friend from my high school class got cancer and passed away at 24, leaving behind his wife and beautiful baby girl. Sometimes stories are just cut short, and we have to do our best to re-write the ending we had envisioned. When you feel alone that is the time to reach out, do not feel as though you need to hide yourself. Your grieving process deserves to be heard and felt fully, so that you can begin to heal. \n\nYou worry about your children, this is a very traumatic time in their life, but you will get through this together. Lean on whatever support systems you have: are your parents close by? Do you have any nearby friends? Could your neighbors come give a hand? I know you want to close yourself off, probably the last thing you want is to open your heart and home to people giving you alien looks. But people are willing and wanting to help. The phrase \"it takes a village\" was invented for just this purpose, you do not need to do this alone. Some ideas might be: pre-made meals, video call movie night with neighborhood kids, visits from grandparents. They're pretty young but what about school programs or clubs? Your kids just lost a huge relationship in their life, the best thing you can do right now is fill their time with other smaller relationships. I know the pandemic is still going on, so I'm sorry that I can't offer more ideas here. \n\nSee if you can find a community/therapy specific to you. Right now the most important thing is your mental health, you may think it's your children but how are you supposed to provide for them if your gas tank is empty? You can't be a giver if you have nothing to give. Take care of yourself, even if it's just 10 minutes in the morning to grieve completely by yourself, your mental health will be that much better for it. \n\nI know it isn't what you want to think about right now but there is a future, a bright future, ahead of you. You and your kids have so much left to do and so many plans to fulfill. Plans and ideas that you made with your wife may feel like they'll never happen now, but they absolutely still can, and this is just one way you can keep her memory alive. This darkness will pass over, and someday you'll be able to smile at your wife's memory. You and your kids are going to be ok.",

My dad and I experienced the tragedy together, and I always worried and still do about what he\u2019s feeling. \n\nGrief is a terrible rollercoaster ride that never lets you get off. Time does help a little, but that loss is not something that can be replaced. \n\nI moved hundreds of miles away from my hometown after my mother\u2019s death because of the exact reason you talk about. Myself or my dad and I couldn\u2019t go anywhere without people staring at us like we were sad stray animals. Everyone knew and loved my mom. I couldn\u2019t go to the store, work, or the dentist without someone coming up and crying and wanting to pry into what happened. \n\nI felt like an alien too and I know my dad did. Experiencing such a sudden and tragic loss makes you feel like you\u2019re on another planet where time doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nI would have never survived my mother\u2019s death without my dad. We were always close, but he\u2019s truly my best friend and we leaned on each other a lot in the first year. I was 22, so I was able to be there for him. I can\u2019t imagine how you must feel going through this with young children. \n\nThere\u2019s no guide to how to navigate this. You and your children will find a way to heal or at least manage so you can continue your lives. I really encourage you to take time for yourself and letting yourself remember your wife and laugh, cry, and feel for her and the baby. You sound like an amazing father. This will feel dark for a long time, but finding joy in little things (something as small as seeing a kid at the park flying a kite with his grandfather) got me through some pretty low points. \n\nYou and your children will come out of this and you will be ok again some day.",

The cost of mental health care is ridiculous (insurance is certainly at fault here), and this kind of care is so badly needed by so many people.  I believe that any practitioner serious about helping as many people as possible should try to look into offering group sessions - again, hopefully it can be navigated with insurance.

        "2046": "I had an experience that was similar (though no where near as serious as not being able to afford therapy) at my stupid optometrist. Long winded story below because it's been eating at me and I wanna say it somewhere, feel free to skip, to OP, I hope you're able to get therapy in the future, I understand it's a big struggle. I'm in Canada, dunno where you are, but even here it's so hard to afford/have time for/have energy for/have transportation to/just everything\n\nI REALLY liked this doctor she was always so nice, but after college, I had no insurance and glasses are pricey so I made do for 4 years with glasses that weren't quite right.\nThe secretary made a comment that I'd waited too long to do a check up when I went in, and I plainly told her \"I had no insurance, I couldn't afford the expense, so I had to wait\" I was pretty proud as I am extremely non confrontational so this was a lot for me. After my check up, I'm back at the desk, and her and my doctor very obviously raise their voices and start joking about how I'd \"waited so long there's such a big change in your eyesight, wow FOUR years can't wait that long hahahaha NEVER let your prescription lapse, why would you DO that hahaha\" everyone was staring at me so I just loudly stated \"I was poor and uninsured. I only came in because now I'm insured\" they didn't care, I'm still baffled and never going back",
        "2047": "Sorry for your experience. \n\nOk so here are the tips I\u2019ve gotten from every therapist I\u2019ve seen for many years. And these are pretty much consistent no matter what\u2019s going on with you.\n-exercise: you don\u2019t have to go hard even if it\u2019s just a walk\n-hydrate and eat nutritious meals: your brain is a machine and needs the right fuel\n- sleep: an absolute must! Not taking naps through the day because that\u2019ll fuck up your sleep schedule. But actually set a sleep schedule and practice good sleep hygiene. (Google if you don\u2019t know, it\u2019ll be a list of tips/do\u2019s&donts) \n-journaling: I hate journaling but it is good and every therapist recommend it to me. It doesn\u2019t have to be a set amount of time or particular subject. I really suck at it and don\u2019t do it everyday but really try to set aside some time everyday to journal. It\u2019s just a good way to put thoughts on paper and kind of releases them from your head instead of just having them bottled up and swirling around. One of my therapist wanted me to write one good thing that happened or one thing I was grateful for each day. Just to break up the negativity and show not everything is bad and this isn\u2019t the worst. So even something small, example: your having what you feel the worst day ever is. You can say hey at least I haven\u2019t stubbed my toe today that\u2019s a plus. So even the smallest thing counts. \n\nSome things I\u2019ve done when I had a lapse in therapy:\n- online resources: there\u2019s a lot of therapist that are on YouTube that have a whole Bunch of content. From explaining conditions, to coping skills, breathing exercises, ect. Just don\u2019t get stuck in the rabbit hole of self diagnosing with every condition lol that\u2019s like webmd. \nOne I watch is Kati Morton. Honestly I just like how she normalizes mental health issues and she talks in a way where you don\u2019t feel guilty or bad for your feelings. \nAlso CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) helps me a lot with my illness. So you could look into if that\u2019s something you\u2019d like. Honestly it\u2019s just a healthy way of thinking for anyone not just people with mental health issues. You can find YouTube channels and workbooks online for this.\n\nLocal support groups, even online a lot are free. A lot of people are turned off of group therapy/ support groups I was too. But I tried and gave is a few trys and found I loved it. So I definitely suggest at least trying it. Usually you can just observe for the first few sessions and then once you get comfortable you can start sharing if you want. \n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of at the moment. I know it\u2019s not a fix or equal to having a therapist but I wanted to give you some realistic and hopefully helpful alternatives. I\u2019ve used these when I have a lapse in care and they helped me. \u2764\ufe0f",

Burns was basically the grandfather of CBT, which there's a good chance would be the method a therapist would use on your anyway if depression is your issue.  Which is not to say that a therapist wouldn't help, but this book might be a good stopover until you can get that together.\n\nAnother option to look into is university therapy.  At my local state university, the psychology department offers extremely low therapy rates (like $10-$25).  The only trade off is that your therapist would be a PhD candidate and so wouldn't have the long term experience of a therapist.  This can be a good thing too, as they're very up to date with the latest research.  Also, at least in Colorado, they have to be supervised by a licensed therapist.\n\nThis was the route that I took.

Some employers and schools offer counseling as well. \n\nPersonally, I gained a few good skills from listening to CBT Great Courses on Audible, but learning from books doesn't always translate the same as having someone to talk to and confide in. It can be good to reach out to others as well.. I know I've gained so much about inquiring about how others handle certain issues or what their approach is to things.

We assume when people from other countries complain about the wait that 1) they are waiting longer than we Americans are (they aren\u2019t typically), that most of their citizens can\u2019t just access private care like we can *if we can pay for it* - it\u2019s just that low income people don\u2019t have to go through what OP describes, and 3) that they pay more (their taxes are about equal to our premiums and cost of care, and are progressively taxed at higher/lower levels depending on patient income). Mainly the time complaint is one I hear a lot - a Brit will whine that the NHS gave them an appointment a month or two out, but my dr does the same to me even when I have private insurance I pay through the nose for. Socialized medicine typically places a longer wait on people with issues that are \u201coptional\u201d to solve (like a bunion removal rather than a broken bone) while in the US the price you pay tends to have more of an impact on how fast you receive care, unless you are actively bleeding out in an ER. Lastly, higher quality of care because drs and nurses aren\u2019t exhausted/busy from having to constantly chart everything specifically for insurance purposes (rather than charting for medical safety, which they would always need to do) and adds a SHITLOAD of unnecessary costs to the backend of medical treatment as hospitals and drs try to recoup their costs from insurance companies who\u2019d rather not pay for it.\n\nI\u2019ve come to this conclusion after hearing from my friends and family members who have experience with both styles of medical systems and who have been nurses/drs in both systems (lots of foreign cousins who went into medicine, experienced US, canadian, Australian, British, and Netherlands healthcare systems), as well as a handful of people who have done backend insurance coding/charting. All my cousins who have practiced medicine in both systems happily earn less in Socialized medicine countries because it\u2019s less stressful. 100% of cousins who needed medical treatment and grew up in US as well as The cousins who grew up in socialized medicine countries steadfastly agree that the socialized version is better all around. When I look at how in debt two of them would\u2019ve been if treated for their issues (one horrific car crash, one autoimmune) they\u2019d be sealed for debt for the rest of their lives. Instead they are comfortably healed up and able to do luxurious things like travel and buy a home rather than rent. Meanwhile I\u2019m pissing away 12,000 a year on health insurance AND spending roughly 5000 on meds a year AND another 10 grand for therapy/psychiatry. My body is a bit of a mess, but I\u2019m not that special. My friends who work in the us healthcare system describe it as trying to plug a bullet wound with a bandaid, it just doesn\u2019t work - the problem immediately overwhelms the solution, the patient gets inadequate care and sent off with a staggering bill. That isn\u2019t what they got into medicine for. They are so burnt out knowing they could provide better care if money and complex insurance documenting wasn\u2019t an issue (they also have more nurses to provide better care, but I digress...)\n\nAnyways, packing up my soapbox.

World-rocking and security-robbing and you're now asking yourself questions that nobody should have to ask themselves, ever. I want you to know that nothing that happened is your fault. You aren't to blame.  You're not a bad person for surviving. You don't have a thing to feel guilty for in all of this, so try not to. I know it's hard. Think of guilt like a heavy weight. This weight is not yours to carry. Try not to carry it too long.\n\nRight now, how you feel is raw and new, like a broken bone. Only so much worse. But, just like a broken bone, it'll slowly start to hurt less, day after day.  What you're feeling right now I think is a healthy and normal reaction. I know it doesn't feel like it, but you're going to be ok. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But someday.\n\nGive yourself time to heal. You don't have to feel normal until you're ready, so don't try to rush back to how things were. It's going to take time. I suggest talking. Surround yourself with family and friends. Talk out how you feel with people you love and trust and who love and trust you back. If you aren't ready or up to do that, writing letters helps me sometimes.\n\nWhen you start feeling a little better (not before, don't rush it!) I'd say start picking up things that you like first. Do you like art? Paint yourself a little something thats for your eyes only. Nobody else ever has to see it if you don't want. Music, same thing. The idea is, when you're ready, give yourself a way to express how you feel.\n\nIt's going to be ok. You aren't to blame. Take it slow, and one day at a time.

But everything started to become normal after six months or so on. So I suggest you to take your time surround yourself people who fun to hang out. Try to get busy with various activities for example : self improvement stuffs and stay far away from anything that reminds you of that terrible event. I hope everything will be alright.

I think as a society we're conditioned to feel like we should move on immediately and jump right back into productive life.\n\nAll of the advice everyone is giving here is great and I second everything people have said, but don't be hard on yourself if you feel like everything is a mess right now and you're not able to follow some of that good advice.

        "2286": "I don't really want to step into the middle of a second amendment debate here... but what do you propose as a solution here?\n\nUltimately, having observed how the media and public respond to school shootings - I really think if they stopped obsessing so much over the perpetrators, and let them die or be arrested as no-name losers, a lot less people would be inclined to commit copycat shootings.\n\nRemember the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007?  Within hours, the killer's name (which I won't repeat) started being spread all over - NBC even aired the guy's manifesto after he had killed himself...now young people everywhere got this idea that if they want to be a martyr, all they had to do was find a gun and shoot up their school and they'll get their 15 minutes of fame\n\nIf not guns, there will always be something.  Back in my day, people made bomb threats.  They had cops lining the building.  These kids will find a way to maim or kill as many people possible, even if somehow guns became illegal.\n\nIMO, the best way to go about this is two-fold...\n\n1: If you see anything (even if it appears to be satire or a joke) posted by another that references violence, hurting or killing other people, REPORT IT TO AUTHORITIES.  In the case of this Michigan shooter, the kid posted photos of him holding the gun, made statements saying \"see you tomorrow, Oxford\", his MOM even posted about her helping him shoot at targets, the *school* knew about this and called his parents over drawings he made of bloody classmates... anyone with a brain would know this kid was up to no good, but yet police were never called, not even by the school.  WTF?\n\n2: If in the event a shooting DOES happen anyway, news media needs to not disclose the identity of the perpetrator, not even photos, nothing.  let that POS rot in jail until the trial.  Focus on the victims, talk about their lives... news got it right this time around until later that day when the killer's name started coming over the airwaves along with photos of him in a prison jumpsuit.\n\nIs it perfect? No, but it should at least disincentivize people from trying to do similar.  Especially if #1 is followed regularly, anyone making vague posts about shooting their school would get charged with a crime and probably think twice about doing it.",

It became a self-sustaining whirlpool that became self hatred over the years - I have pretty bad depression, SAD and a less severe autistic spectrum disorder, all of which were diagnosed a long time after all this. I'd say there was an easy solution but it was rough for me:\n\nI hit rock bottom several times. Each time I just gave up to the misery, and after each time I had to rebuild myself, trying to make a better more sustainable person out of the ashes. Finally after a really bad one I had enough with the constant guilt, and I don't know why but I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't waste any more energy on self loathing.\n\nFirst off I made myself look at an unwelcome memory when it came up, but from a purely analytical point of view, and figure out a lesson from it - what I could say the next time that situation happened, or what I learned to avoid, that kind of thing. I had to keep doing this over and over again, but eventually the intrusive thoughts started to become less and less important.\n\nSecondly, I learned to laugh at myself when I fucked up, and own it. If I fell on my arse in front of people I would try to laugh and take a bow. I learned how to use offensive humour to break social tension. I learned to stop taking myself too seriously. This also took years of practice, as well as some friends who stuck with this newest version of me. I now automatically force myself to take a hold of the uncertainty and rip it up.\n\nAfter all this, I am more comfortable with myself now than I ever used to be. I'm not finished - and I never will be. Life isn't reaching some standard, it's being able to change, and look at yourself critically and not negatively and deciding to make a positive change.

        "2307": "Sounds like flashbacks. It could be that your feelings about that memory tie into a broader picture regarding how you felt as a child, the guilt you carry, etc.",

        "2310": "Yeah, it happens to everyone and I mean everyone. Its not a sign of mental issues, unless the memories do more than make you feel like shit temporarily. \nWe all have done things we regret, sometimes we regret instantly, sometimes it takes years of maturing to realise how wrong we were, sometimes it had bad consequences, sometimes it did nothing except being humiliating. Unfortunately, I dont have any tricks for it to stop happening. All I can tell you is to forgive yourself. If you feel like it, you can even appologize to your mom. The memory and guilt will still be there, but at least you would have tried to make amends. \n\nMemories will stick with us for a long time. You can't erase the past. It's like... It's like your exes. As much as you may hate them,now, as much as you are happy now with yourself, or with someone else, you still have memories (good or bad) of being with your ex. And sometimes you can be horrified because you just dreamed of an ex. It doesn't necessarily mean you subconsciously want to go back with them, it doesn't mean you don't like your current partner, it just mean that your ex, with whom you shared a part of your life, is in your memories, and will stay there for a long while. \n\nIts the same with bad memories. They will always be there. Why they come back out of know here I can't tell. But there here to stay. My bad memories still hurt, but I made amends where it was needed.",

I have so much to time to think and all those thoughts from years ago pop up all the time.

Like when I was attending school in a one room schoolhouse, I had a Special Ed social worker come over to check on me once or twice a week. During Halloween, I dressed up as a vampiress and had this phony Transylvanian accent tht kept changing dialects. I stayed in character while talking with him and it was so cringe! \ud83d\ude23 Or when a 13 year old neighbor boy seduced me at 8 years old. The guilt really traumized me.

You're not alone, I hope that helps.",

        "2336": "On a personal note, as a mother, she likely completely understood. She would have felt badly but not because of you. Her situation was the problem, not her most precious love wanting to be safe. She wanted that for you too. My daughters could never hurt me with things like this because I am well aware of every way I have failed them. It might sting when mentioned because it would be a hot topic, but it wouldn\u2019t be something they create. My daughters want their own home instead of renting. I feel grief stricken that I can\u2019t provide that for them, but my feelings are not their fault. It was something I felt long before they ever mentioned it.",

Sometimes even how people have treated me haunts me in an odd way, asif I deserved it when I definitely didn't. It is usually when my mental state is getting into a depressive state. I could be fine with past things and probably believe that I am over it. I think I usually am over it though but it hits me all over again and I suddenly feel intense guilt and pain that lasts for days. It is as though my mind brings back horrible memories and I have to go through each one constantly. Soon as the depressive episode is over those thoughts have little to no effect on me. It is a horrible experience.",
        "2338": "What I find helps, is to think about the event. Yeah having a fit over thrift store clothing as a kid wasn't good and added to your moms stress, but as you said you where 10. Forgive yourself for the things that are in the past.",

I still get a random reminder of this one time when I was 8 and playing at a friend's house, and her mum brought out her dinner, and I just.... stuck my finger in the mashed potato. I don't know why I did it, but I knew it was wrong. Then I freaked out and ran home and told my mum everyone was a liar and I didn't do anything and to leave me alone forever. It still makes me feel sick to the bottom of my stomach and full of shame and embarassment and guilt.\n\nThis is the only sort of one that I can actually share because the rest make me feel genuinely suicidal.",

        "2341": "All the time. Some more intense than others. Some days one might even realize things from their past that could shake them to their very core. But the important thing to do what that happens is to remind yourself of the good you\u2019ve done. Or of the better moments. Everyone has a past, made mistakes, said things that were hurtful.

        "2357": "I am a hypnotherapist and I deal with these common issues.\n\nHere's what has helped me and what I've learned;\n\n1. When the feelings arise with the thoughts, take a very deep breath, filling your lungs as much as you can.\n\n2. Release the breath.\n\n3. Disconnect with the thoughts and feel the emotions. Disconnect with the thoughts by taking another smaller deep breath.\n\n4. Feel the emotions and breathe through it. You can even imagine dark energy leaving your body and refill the body with light. Usually you'll feel like a tangible heart pain, accompanied by anxiety. It is important not to get to distracted by the thoughts at this point because it will lock the emotion in your body if you can't break free from the thoughts. It's ok to think about the trauma that caused the pain. This is the energy arising to the surface. It is natural to think about the source trauma and thoughts causing your emotional pain. Remember, do your best not to get locked in the thought because the pattern of; think the thought, feel the pain, think the thought, feel the pain will repeat.\n\n5. Continue deeply breathing through the pain. More pain will arise but you MUST continue breathing through it. If it gets too much take a break. But the longer you avoid facing and releasing the trauma, the longer your problems will last. \n\n6. Depending how much guilt and shame you have stored in your body this will take time. \n\n7. When you're done, and you no longer feel the emotional pain rising up, sit in this moment as long as you can. Tell yourself \"I am healing and progressing. I love myself. I am growing. I am evolving.\" In this relaxed state, the subconscious mind becomes very open, and these affirmations install \"programs\" into your brain to help you deal with future emotions.\n\nSide notes; \nWe are never perfect or complete.\n\nWe are energy beings. Thus, using the deep breathing method can release stored traumas by intending we are now choosing to release the pain.\n\nWhen we store traumas we will get manifestations of sickness like cancer, colds, sore throats, etc. We can also get pain like shoulder, back, and knee pain.\n\nIt is easier and safer to use this natural method to release the pain rather then burying it, taking meds and continuing to manifest sickness from the toxic energy. \n\nThis is one form of healing thru trauma. There are other natural ways.\n\n One way is by writing down the thoughts that trigger the pain, and why you feel the way you do when that thought comes across your mind. Next, meditate by taking a deep breath, release, and then take another deep breath. As you release it notice how your lungs and chest feel as you breathe naturally. Keep bringing your attention to the chest. Once you feel deeper relaxed, say something to yourself like \"as I continue breathing, I am fully releasing the trauma and bringing in happiness (feel happiness), peace (feel it), and joy (feel it).\" This method requires more attention and professional help. However, try it by yourself. It can only help.\n\nIt is important to remember that healing is a process, it is painful and if left untreated (self-treatment is extremely valid, dont doubt yourselves) it will get worse, potentially causing constant suicidal thoughts and may ultimately end up with you taking your own life.\n\nLast thing, we are meant to experience deep energy here on Earth. Do not beat yourselves up for experiencing life and its grand adventure.\n\nBless you and your healing. Good luck!",

After thinking I agree and she most likely wasn\u2019t mad or having negative emotions for me, but my unconscious ability to make my mom feel bad about where we were at is a bit of a sting to me.

My friend didn\u2019t like something I said (sometimes I say things that sound terrible but I don\u2019t know why because usually I have a good filter) and because he\u2019s blunt and may have low level Aspergers, he just told me we\u2019re not gonna be friends because what I said (it wasn\u2019t about him, i at the time was talking about my sister and called her bad names). I started to shake, hyperventilate, and feel super hot for god knows why. I had the thought about our conversation come up and haunt me for months.

Everytime they come to surface you just push them aside because they make you feel guilty. What you should do instead is let them fully come to the surface and process them properly. Think well about what actually happened, context, causes, consequences, what you could and couldn't control, what you did wrong and if you regret it, if you grew out of it and are a different person right now, ask yourself why do you feel like this and other questions relevant in the matter. \n\nProcessing of emotions is a bit of an abstract matter and it may be different for anyone and hard to put into words, but the idea is to no longer supress them by trying to pretend they never happened because they\u00b4ll always come back and you only solved the problem temporarily.",

One thing I can think of that's slightly weirdly positive about it is that we must really care and have a heart even though it is such an unhealthy experience.

You have to have 2 out of the 3 to be diagnosed officially. You can\u2019t fake those results, much like you can convince yourself of something mentally and then doubt if it was real later. That gave me a lot of insight. \n\nI feel a lot better now. I still have days, but they don\u2019t bother me anymore as much.",

Not sure what your quitting, but booze lowers your inhibitions, but inhibitions are what keeps you clean. And just say goodbye to any friends even slightly involved in that old life. They may be good people, but they can't be your friends anymore. Connect with people you knew before, people who love you and want the best for you first. Stay strong. Its never over, but it does get easier. ",

I also found that in an effort to nit blow money on drugs I\u2019d take whatever paychecks I didn\u2019t use for bills and Immediately buy gift cards to Michael\u2019s or AC Moore craft stores that way I could purchase art supplies as a coping skill instead of using the cash for drugs. That way I could use it for my creative outlet spending (canvas and art supplies get hella expensive too) and not on opiates or benzos.) I paint too to help cope with major depressive disorder, PTSD, and addiction. I will definitely look you up on Instagram. Art is a fabulous coping skill and has definitely gotten me through some really difficult times in my life. I am currently in a relapse but you\u2019ve definitely inspired me... might just go downstairs and pick up my inks and brush!

You dropping it is likely due to distractions of what is effecting you to stop doing what you\u2019re motivated to do. Let\u2019s say for example (this is the one that applied to me and may not be the same for you, I\u2019m going to mention it anyway though) you are addicted to a video game or a social media platform when you want to study. When your in bed, you don\u2019t have to energy to go on social media or play on the game so you just think and you realise what you need to do. What I believe the best thing to do is (it may not be the best, I\u2019m not a phycologist) is to literally do at least something close to what you want to achieve that night that will effect you the next day or take away the distraction. For me, that was deleting social media off my phone as well as all the games I had. The next day I started getting upset and stayed in my room (probably withdrawal symptoms) but because I already deleted my games, I didn\u2019t need to worry about doing anything extreme and the day after I was able to study again. This obviously isn\u2019t the same as something like alcoholism but I feel it could apply to anything. Getting rid of what\u2019s holding you back (at least temporarily) will help push you towards what you want to achieve. The next 3 am you get I think you should do this (although it may not be the same for certain situations, respond if there\u2019s a problem). You can guarantee you will be happier in the long run",

I can carry some of it forward into the next day normally, but damn I wish I could have that sort of focus and idea generation in the daytime. Super weird.\n\nI asked my therapist about this and she said the nighttime productivity/creativity might occur because there's nothing to distract me then, so I can think more clearly. I also struggle with a lot of anxiety during the day, and have found that my anxiety levels are normally lowest at night (when I've burned through my daily cortisol?)--so maybe I just have less stress standing in the way at 3AM.

But never really any plan or action to my thoughts. It wasn't until I found out the real thing that was holding me back from taking action. Here are 4 strategies you can use to try to help you navigate these thoughts and start to put a plan together so you can start taking action.\n\nReally break these thoughts down into tangible goals. Think about one of the thoughts and try to write it out as an action. Thinking of all the layers and steps involved in your idea. This first part is very visual, try to visualize this to the point of where you can see you doing the action, smell the environment etc...\n\nOnce you have the goal or idea written down in  a sentence, ask yourself some questions: in a perfect world how will I complete this task, what is holding me back from doing this, where should I start with this, how would completing this make me feel, why do I want to complete this. \n\nLastly think about your plan of action, how does it make you feel. Think about the initiating step of getting started, are you scared, are you nervous are you anxious? Now sit with those feelings for a bit. Taking the first step is always the scariest, starting something new brings anxiety, fear, excitement, but remember the first step is the hardest. Challenge yourself by stepping out of your comfort zone.\n\nAnd remember give yourself grace. Try not to be so hard on yourself, we all make mistakes, mistakes do not define us, the defining moment is what we do with those mistakes.",

I found that I preferred working on that time because it was quiet and peaceful then. There was no pressure. No one was watching me, no one was even awake. I could be or do anything I wanted at that time. However, I still needed to wake up on time. Go to work or school on time. Be awake and give all my attention to other people on time. The consistent lack of sleep and lack of motivation made this difficult. I\u2019d usually go through my day in zombie mode thinking about how I\u2019d rather be home sleeping or watching tv, then I\u2019d get home and crash. I\u2019d wake up at around 8pm, procrastinate a lot, then start doing things to unwind or work at 10pm until 4am. Then repeat. It quickly and very easily becomes a vicious cycle.\n\nI\u2019m told it\u2019s a very common symptom of depression to procrastinate on everything like this. I did manage to fix this habit, but only after getting on medication that fixed my motivation problem and worked on myself. Now I wake up at 6am to have my quiet time, go for a run and watch the sunrise and get an early start on work.  I put myself on a schedule that is reinforced by alarms from my iPhone to start and stop working at a certain time, go to bed at 10pm, and wake up at 6am.

        "2618": "This is kind of like dopamine detoxing. Dopamine is your drive and motivation system. When you are down and depressed your dopamine production is extremely low meaning you lack drive to do even the most basic things even when important. The problem with addictions, such as video games, is it produces lots of dopamine and \"feels\" good. You become sensitised to this level dopamine. This coupled with the low amount of dopamine produced the rest of the time means you crave and seek out levels of dopamine that you are still sensitive too, in other word back to video games. This is very similar to how the body builds up resistances to caffeine as well. You can reset your dopamine sensitivity by taking a few days off activities you know to be producing large amounts of it. Like when cutting caffeine out of your diet, you will feel like shit while doing this, so expect this and be compassionate to yourself while doing it. Afterwards you should find yourself with more drive and motivation to tackle some more mundane tasks and activities.\n\nOf course, it's a lot easier said than done, and if you suffer from depression you just simply may not be producing enough dopamine to feel like doing anything anyway. I can only suggest looking into mindfulness, meditation and self-compassion. It sounds like hippy bs but, like above, serves a very (bio-)mechanical purpose in the brain.",

Basically it was one of the many signs, so I'm in no way suggesting anyone else who has late night motivation has BPD or NPD.   \n\n\nBut anyways, ya it was just one of the many signs. BPD and anything related to sleep is a big indicator. So while my \"late night motivation\" certainly wasn't being done while I was physically sleeping, it was in that winding down period. When your brain just starts getting ready to crash for the night. I would have so much enthusiasm for tomorrow, for my life, for my goals, what I was going to do, what I was going to change, ect.   \n\n\nOf course like so many, when I woke up it was an afterthought.   \n\n\nBut because it was being done during that period of 'wind down' brain/sleep function, coupled with the intensity of the \"motivation\" they were grandiose. They weren't just, \"I'm going to wake up and shower\" or \"I'm going to wake up and exercise\" they were more I'm going to change my life, I'm going to be the best version of myself, I'm going to be super successful, I'm going to be important.    \n\n\nVery much on the extreme end of motivation. Unrealistic really. I'm going to wake up and start working out and I'm going to be as big as Brock Lesnar one day. No, no your not. He's a genetic freak who's spent 25-30 years working out to get there.   \n\n\n  \nSo again, it was because it was being done during the early sleep cycle (in terms of brain activity) because of the context, because of all the other signs (that had nothing to do with sleepcycle/motivation) it was felt that BPD and NPD were pretty strong contenders for conditions.",

I guess the Narc thing took me by surprise, idk. \n\nAnyway, if you don't feel like talking about it nbd. Just caught my attention is all.",
        "2634": "Dont have an issue talking about it at all. \n\nIt was one of the many signs. Many many signs. I've learned over the years how to be very introspective. Now that may seem very anti-narcissistic behaviour but it actually comes from a very deep seeded Narcissistic place. \n\nI want to talk about myself, my problems, my issues, my everything. Like I am now. Now, let me be clear, you're not enabling me right now. I genuinely like to help people better understand themselves, and I guess me too. I do get a reward from helping people. \n\nSo anyways, because i've been able to really share, speak and be honest about my thoughts, my feelings, my struggles, my everything, I've been able to dump so much information and so many different signs of Narc and BPD. \n\nIt was a pretty cut and dry diagnosis once I was able to sit down with someone and do their stupid testing and dump my thoughts into them. \n\nSo ya, it was just one of the many things. \n\nAnother big one was my inability to have empathy for someone. I've had long term partners, people i've genuinely cared for, I'm hesitant to say 'loved' anymore, but 100% I cared for them. I've sat across from them, them crying in emotional or physical pain, all I had to do was reach out for them and I would make it all better, and have the inability to do so. I would blankly stare at them, right through their eyes, thinking the whole time \"Why dont they stop\" \"Why dont I feel anything\" Knowing the entire time what I was doing was wrong, but not able to do anything about it. Them screaming at me \"Just reach out for me, hold me\" and me just frozen, unable to do so. \n\nLooking back through my life this was the case with everyone i've cared for. \n\nBut what made it all change, was my daughter. I'm a father to three girls. 18/16 and 6. \n\nI love my kids. I really do. I feel for them things I've never felt for anyone. One day, not too long ago, I had my youngest daughter with me. She was crying at one edge of the couch, and I was at the other. I wasn't speaking to her, I wasn't comforting her, I wasn't reaching out to her. \n\nIt wasn't until she looked up at me, with tears in her eyes and reached her arms out, did I reach out for her. The MOMENT I reached out for her, she jumped into my lap, wrapped herself up in my arms and cried. I held her, and cried. I realized then in that moment that something was seriously wrong with me and I just hurt my baby girl. Sitting here now, I'm tearing up thinking about that moment. Just typing it out now, I can relive and feel the hurt in her and the disappointment I had in myself. \n\nI failed her. And I never want to fail anyone like that ever again. The pain I must have caused my exes. Nobody deserves that. \n\n\nWith in days I had spoken to a Dr, had a referral to mental health, and I had reached out to my exes, apologizing for my behaviour. Taking ownership of what must have been a terrible terrible experience. \n\nI cant say I'll never do it again. But I can say that now I know why I did it, why I do it, why I've done it so many times in the past. From the physical pain I've caused so many people growing up, to the emotional pain I've ignored in so many people who've trusted me enough to give themselves emotionally to me. \n\nI fucked up. \n\n\nSo anyways, I may not have 10/10 down the checklist of Narc symptoms, but those I do have, are clearly a symptom of something greater at play in my head. \n\nSo now comes the long journey of recovery, therapy, and making amends.",

So before any meds, try other ways. Get yourself tired, do some sport (idealy with friends) or do some workout daily (20 minutes should be enough for begging, you can of course extend it). Some bike or walk trips should be really helpful (try with others then you will know if it's better with them or alone).

I know it sounds simplistic but sometimes when we are grieving we forget about the little things because were lost in the big picture.

I\u2019d give you a mighty bro hug right now if I knew you. \n\nHold it together best you can. Use this moment as a lesson for your son to learn that grief is okay, crying is okay. Being emotional is okay. \n\nSeek out therapy if need be, or send me a message and I\u2019ll be happy to shoot the shit with you. \n\nTake care friend.",

Allow yourself to feel what you need to feel and seek out support where and however you can (this post is a great start). \n\nI know this couldn\u2019t be easy to share but the message about getting help is so very important  and reading posts like this about parents with mental health issues is exactly what pushed me to work on my own mental health issues now before I have a family who those issues would affect. I hope sharing that doesn\u2019t come across an insensitive, but I wanted you to know that sharing his story really may help someone who comes across it push themselves to get help. \n\nTake care of yourself.

But take solace in the fact that there are people out there that care about you, even people you don't even know, like myself. I don't know what the situation is like for you regarding therapy or getting \"help\". But maybe it would already do you wonders if you have someone in your life you can open up to, just to vent.

Some people are renting forever because they chose to have kids early and struggled to find a career that enables them to buy.\n\nWe're all working on different things in our lives. It's ok to be behind, as long as you keep trying to improve yourself.\n\nDon't work to catch up. Work to meet your own goals.",

It doesn\u2019t look anything like what a 25 year olds life is \u201csupposed to\u201d look like. But if I can get past that nagging insecurity, I know it\u2019ll be the best thing for me.

Just google every question you have and find what makes something click! I figured out I really enjoy computer hardware so I'm getting into IT and I'm teaching myself to code. It's really fuckin hard and i still kinda hate myself. Oh ya in the 5 years since i graduated i gained like 70 lbs and became an alcoholic. Things are way better since the new year and i feel alive and well again. You'll be good i promise. Just put your head to the grindstone and stop comparing yourself to your peers. That was my number one problem. It was fine when I was 19 and everyone was partying with me but now I'm 25 and everyone is either dead, has kids and a house or has moved away and gotten married.

It sucks and I really hate myself for putting this off again. I thought I had enough to crank out the paper in a few days well those few days turned into 2 and then one and then I realized how fucked I am. Every time I think about it or even up to 2 weeks ago when I would try to start writing something I would have a panic attack and my only relief was to stop and distract myself.\n\nI\u2019m miserable and have no real excuse for this behavior.

They talk as adults, like business people would, they travel the world alone \n(to be fair, I did manage to travel to London alone because I REALLY wanted to see a musical before it ended.

        "2868": "I completely, COMPLETELY relate to what you're feeling. In my 20's, I was successful in my corporate career, I was a high performer, etc etc. But inside, nobody knew how lonely and ashamed I was. I was very overweight, had no self-confidence, so dating went nowhere. Meanwhile my friends were all getting married. It was brutal, honestly. I was depressed and nobody knew it.\n\nThen at one point, I decided it had to change. I switched to a plant based diet and lost 100 pounds. Along the way I discovered I needed to help others do the same, so I quit my career on wall street and went back to medical school. In doing so, I discovered the person I was meant to be. I discovered who I truly was beneath the shame. And by living into that vision of myself, I effortlessly attracted the love of my life.\n\nWe got married at 35 years old. Behind my friends? Sure. But now I also have friends my age who got married in their early 20's, they and their spouses grew into different people, and now they're divorced or on the verge of it.\n\nWhat I learned is that feeling behind is entirely perspective. I found the woman of my dreams and married her. I have more energy and purpose and health now at 36 than I did at 21. And I get to help other ambitious individuals end self-criticism and silence the negative voice in their head by teaching principles of everyday mental health.\n\nLooking back, I wouldn't have it any other way. Hang in there friend. Design your future self and live into that vision today.\n\n\\- Dr. K",

Hated the apartment in part of town that wasnt ideal. Never shopped. went a decade without going on vacation. i met my husband and he had similar financial challenges so we started to meet them together with excel spreadsheets and constant accountabiloty and monitoring. \n\nfor years it felt like it would never. end. we got married cheaply in 2014 when i was 32. continued with our goals. we saved and bought a nice house in 2016. had two kids and continued to drive beatup cars. after a couple payraises and gaining experience i got a big bump in pay finally in 2019 at 37. my husband lost his job in 2019 so we need to re-catch up with savings but overall weve got good jobs low six figures ancouple kids and a nice house. it took a complete and total focus on advancing our jobs while being frugal. \n\nmy parents were not well off at all so i feel \u201crich\u201d now by comparison. when i was 18 i had no idea how much work it would be but i did spend my adult life 18-mis 30s working hard toward being better off eith seemingly zero reward. but eventually the goals all came to fruition bc we had solid plans and stayed focused. it didnt come easy and it was so much patience. but totally worth it.",

So, I went because \"fuck it\" and when I showed up I was greeted by a large Mexican man covered in waxing strips and for the first time in years I felt ok.\n\nThey didn't ask questions.

She broke up with me around June, saying I deserve better , that she has been unhappy with herself, she doesn\u2019t feel like herself anymore. The very next day she came back crying, saying she was sorry and made a mistake and didn\u2019t want us to be over, and that she will work on herself and that she loved me. The most recent breakup was over the same things. She blindsided me with this breakup, I thought things were so much better but she said the same stuff. She said how she needs to be alone to find her happiness, which I understand. She has been so cold to me since the breakup it\u2019s painful. I just want her to know if she feels like she made a mistake, I am here for her. If she feels like she needs someone, I am here for her. \n\nThanks for listening.",

When she messaged me back it like reset my \"conversation timer\" and I felt so happy and relieved and told her about my problem. This isn't anything I do to family or friends but I've done it to a few people I've become acquainted with online.

If people have the option not to do something, many won't. I have had someone who was very lazy sponge off me (ex husband) in the name of depression. Yet I was diagnosed with major depression, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, OCD, psychosomatic symptoms plus real health issues and I still worked and took care of basic responsibilities. Despite having been in inpatient psychiatric units, nearly dying, etc etc. So because some people use it as an excuse to be lazy, that's where some of the stigma comes from. \n\nDepression may be an illness, just like my thyroid disease or vertigo I have. But there is still choice - to get up, shower, work, whatever. It's a choice. Depression and various other health issues make that hard, trust me I know. But depression diagnosis should not be viewed as an automatic get out of jail free card where you can ditch all responsibilities and not have anyone pissed off at you or criticizing your lack of discipline. \n\nDepression for me tends to be a very deep sadness where I cry every day and I can't see the point in anything. It's not an absence of feelings for me, I'm more of a wreck, crying and feeling I'm having a nervous breakdown and will suffocate. It's different to my anxiety in that it feels like sadness and grief and not panicky. I have mininal energy and struggle with all tasks including getting out of bed. I use alcohol to cope. I can't control my thoughts or feelings, but I  can control my actions. I am imperfect but on tge outside, my life does not look stereotypically like a severely depressed person, which is part of why professionals don't/won't help me. Despite my history of not leaving the house for 5 years or living in a psych unit, they feel that because I go to work then I must be okay but I am not okay. You get punished in a way for being high functioning with depression, then have to put up with others claiming depressed people can't do anything or have responsibilities. So people with depression may feel hard done by that people judge them for checking out. But I've checked out completely and also been high functioning.. and I can tell you that people actually do have more compassion for the checked out types than someone who's living a \"normal life\" but drinks 500ml of liquor a day or cries non stop.

All just fucking too sorry for themselves. Cos they got rejected or got told of by their parents. These people are fake they don\u2019t understand depression. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to think about how they would kill themselves everyday. They don\u2019t know the self-hatred. Or the constant existential nihilism that arises whenever something has to be done. They don\u2019t know; how drug overdoses feel, how the throbbing pressure in your face feels as you tied a noose around your neck, how the coarse sting of bleach feels in the throat and how it leaves you with acid reflux for your whole life, or how you have to plan out your outfit to hide scars rather than how it looks.  Ik some people mean well and try to spread awareness but that in itself is ignorance. Telling people they need to talk to someone like they believe that the person has the ability to do so. And no for some people nothing helps. Nothing. No amount of counselling or medication will ever distract them from the fact that their life up until this point has been so painful that they have no hope for the future of it. People can go round preaching about how they were once depressed and how one day their brain just snapped out of it, maybe because of medication or because they found someone they loved. But really they\u2019ve just bought into the delusion that their whole life isn\u2019t really meaningless. For some of us we can only drown our pain in materialistic possessions and in our love for others for so long. The fact is love isn\u2019t real it\u2019s an ideal. It\u2019s lust or desire in disguise. Everyone masks it as some irrational power but it\u2019s not it\u2019s completely rational and we are just too afraid to admit it because if we do we\u2019d all realise there\u2019s nothing for us here. So yeah I\u2019m 18 and depressed, and have anxiety, PTSD, drug induced psychosis, and also an unbreakable psychological addiction to drugs. Ik exactly why I have depression and it\u2019s not because I\u2019ve had terrible life experiences, although those probably made it worse, it\u2019s because I inherited it genetically from two severely depressed parents. It\u2019s in my brain and I can\u2019t escape it. I can\u2019t have it conditioned out of me it\u2019s basic brain chemistry serotonin, dopamine. Medication could\u2019ve helped though. If only I wasn\u2019t self medicating years before. Taking ecstasy, weed. Benzos, opiates, alcohol regularly, fuck I even huff fucking deodorant when my supply is dry just because drugs are literally all I have left now. Now my brains even more fucked up and it\u2019s probably likely I\u2019ve lost in some capacity the ability to feel joy. I have no sex drive, no aspirations, nothing I\u2019m just living my last days in a frenzy of excess. Distracting myself with material items and drugs I can\u2019t even afford. I\u2019ve burnt through thousands of \u00a3s in the last few months and I don\u2019t even pay for anything because I live with my parents. I don\u2019t have a job and I just scrape together what money I can earn from selling drugs to afford drugs. I\u2019m living my last few days/ weeks and I only have to wait now until the right time. I have a plan. And I\u2019m slowly coming to terms with the pain of death from my other attempts so my fear is declining. I just have a few more things to do and unless some miracle happens and my mind is fixed by something I\u2019m pretty sure I will finally get to die. Shit this is a long ass comment thanks if you bothered to read this shit. There\u2019s a little insight into what proper depression is. It wasn\u2019t meant to go on that long and looking back at it the motivation may have been that I have a lot of emotion that I\u2019ve kept to myself for a while now and for some reason this post triggered its release. However, this does not mean that I made this shit up. I have been diagnosed with all those disorders/ issues by a healthcare professional so I don\u2019t want to see any dick head comments saying I\u2019m bullshitting.

It\u2019s worth it in my opinion, I\u2019ve gotten to see a few of mine. \n\nSometimes when you feel like there is absolutely no point in living, helping someone else can give you meaning. Maybe you\u2019d like to someday help teenagers get the help they need? That doesn\u2019t mean going to university for years to get a degree, it could be volunteering with an organization that helps underprivileged youth. If you like animals it could be fostering dogs/cats that would otherwise be put down. It could be volunteering/working at a senior home. Maybe if you try one of the treatments you haven\u2019t tried yet you might get to a better place mentally and physically you could go to school for addictions counselling, or study psychology to help other people that need it desperately. Suicide and crisis hotlines need volunteers. When I feel like I can\u2019t life for myself I try to live for someone else. Whether it be my parents, or people I don\u2019t know that need help. \n\nFrom the sounds of your post there\u2019s one major thing you haven\u2019t experienced that is worth waiting to...and that\u2019s waking up without a hangover or in withdrawal and having hope. I\u2019ve had it a few times and it\u2019s fucking worth it. To stand outside on a sunny day, feel the warmth on your face and feel calm inside. I know it feels impossible now. But right now you seem to have convinced yourself there is no hope or helping you. If you give yourself one more chance, and put everything you have into doing everything you can...then at least after everything you can say you exhausted all of your options. I know it\u2019s exhausting. I know what it\u2019s like to have a dysfunctional family, how it feels to wake up and have the first thing that crosses your mind be \u201chow can I get high, what do I have, I need it now\u201d I didn\u2019t think I would ever get past that. It took me until I was 25 to and I\u2019m only 26. \n\nAgain, please don\u2019t think I\u2019m dismissing your pain. It is valid. Im so sorry you are going through this. There can be hope, but you have to allow yourself to think there is hope. \ud83d\udc95\n",

        "3352": "In all honesty, we need better vocabulary.  The two aren't related at all, but because we use the same words everyone who's been sad for a couple of days thinks medical depression is the same as that.  Then they can get better by doing things like leaving the house with friends and think it works on medical depression.",
        "3353": "Thing is I\u2019m not physically addicted to a single substance. I\u2019m mentally addicted to not being sober. I\u2019ve done so many different drugs because I get bored quickly and my tolerance builds up to fast for it to be cost effective. Whenever I do anything the first thing I think is, I wish I was high rn. Whenever I go out to a restaurant, I\u2019ll smoke weed cos it\u2019s better. Whenever I party, I\u2019ll drink till I drop and then pop pingerz or do blow till I wake back up. I\u2019ve tried separating myself from drugs and it\u2019s all I think about. Even when I try to quit I\u2019ll end up drinking the smoking because everything is just better. In my experience there\u2019s literally a drug for every occasion. In my GCSE art exams I did ecstasy. If I\u2019m doing a presentation for class I\u2019ll take like half a xan and a couple shots then maybe also take ecstasy to perk up my energy levels. I can feel my body dying and I\u2019m only 18. I get headaches nearly everyday even when I\u2019ve been sober for a week I\u2019ll get mild stomach cramps all the time. Mentally I feel like I\u2019ve done as much damage as you can possibly do from drugs. My serotonin is long gone from multiple week long binges of ecstasy. I have HPPD from whatever idek probably 2cb. I have psychosis from chronic abuse of weed and stimulants. Luckily I\u2019m scared of heroin and shit cos I\u2019ve watched too many documentaries but I\u2019d be lying if I said I haven\u2019t considered it. There\u2019s just no point whatever I do I\u2019ll never be satisfied. Yeah I\u2019ve travelled but I can\u2019t do that anymore because I\u2019ll just get bored from not being able to get high. Plus because of my PTSD and anxiety I don\u2019t feel safe anywhere but in my room. I get anxiety when my parents speak to me so leaving the house makes me feel sick on a daily basis unless I smoke weed. I have even started carrying knives and stuff because I\u2019m afraid for my life when I leave the house. So not only am I paranoid of normal people but I\u2019m paranoid of teachers and police. I don\u2019t trust a single person not even my girlfriend. I was convinced that my best friend was trying to steal from me and I was convinced my other friend was trying to manipulate me and control my mind. I can\u2019t handle shit anymore. There\u2019s honestly no alternative. My doctor might prescribe diazepam for my anxiety and I\u2019ll just abuse that until I run out and I\u2019ll be back to where I was in a couple days. There\u2019s honestly no hope for me anymore. Whatever I do everything will continue to get worse. I\u2019m slowly losing everything I\u2019ve ever loved. 5 members of my family have died in the last four years. My family is barely scraping through financially. I\u2019ve been kicked out of 3 high schools and now I\u2019m in college and I\u2019m about to be kicked out again. I\u2019ve got no friends because I don\u2019t trust anyone. My dad doesn\u2019t give a fuck about me. My mums too depressed in herself to even recognise that fact that I\u2019m slowly killing myself. I regularly go months without speaking to my brother because I have no relationship with any of my family anymore because they sent me of to boarding school at a young age where I was beaten up, bullied and abused all the time for three years. Honestly there\u2019s one person in the whole world that gives a fuck about me and that\u2019s my girlfriend but I don\u2019t really love her like that anymore but I\u2019m just scared to break up with her because her Dad just died a month ago and I want to be there for her but the stress of keeping up a relationship that I don\u2019t even think I want to be in for nearly a year is making me go insane. I don\u2019t even know what I want anymore I just need it all to stop and the only things that have ever worked were drugs and now they\u2019re making everything worse. My only life aspiration is to become famous and rich so I can do more drugs and buy pointless shit but I know that won\u2019t happen and even if it does I\u2019m still gonna kill myself anyway because really there\u2019s no point in life. I\u2019m not special I\u2019ll never have an impact on anyone\u2019s life for the better. I\u2019m so unmotivated to do anything and whenever something bad happens the first thing I think is \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter anyway cos I can just kill myself\u201d. I\u2019ve tried to get better I really have. I quit drugs for like six months but I was still depressed. If I\u2019m like this now at the age of 18 imagine the state I\u2019ll be in, in a couple years. I\u2019ll be homeless and then I\u2019ll just kill myself. I may as well just end it now. Weird thing is I don\u2019t even feel sad anymore. I used to. But now I have realised that the only real option I have is to kill myself. At least then I get to choose how much pain I go through.\n\nThanks for speaking to me. Felt really good to actually talk to someone. You\u2019re a nice person. You deserve a good life. Be happy.",

That is an amazing accomplishment and way to go! \n\nI completely understand because it's been really hard for me lately (by lately, I mean 3+ years, maybe more) to find the motivation, desire, etc to put any effort into my personal hygiene. \n\nI know most people would probably be grossed out by my current routine and they would probably tell me I'm disgusting.\n\nHowever, the people who would say that have most likely never had to deal with major depression. \n\nThey've probably never had to unexpectedly lose the love of their life.\n\nAlso, they probably don't know that over washing can be just as problematic as under.\n\nRegardless, know that I'm so proud of you!

At the start of my freshman year of high school when the new dance season started, which would have been my 10th, I just remember one day waking up and suddenly I wasn\u2019t excited to go to dance anymore. Of course there were always some days where I didn\u2019t want to because I was tired but this was different. When I thought about dance I didn\u2019t get the same feeling I did before. I remember crying to my dad in the car and saying I didn\u2019t want to anymore. I couldn\u2019t understand why. I was so upset to give it up, reaching the 10 year milestone in my studio was a big deal, they gave you a special shoutout during the recitals and everything. I couldn\u2019t wait for the day I was a senior in high school and I got to do the special dance with the other high school seniors to honor them as we \u201cgraduated\u201d from the studio. And then one day I just... didn\u2019t care anymore. Looking back I know now it was because I was in the height of my depression. I became severely depressed in 8th grade, although I had signs of depression and anxiety for much much longer. I still miss it a lot and one day I hope to take some adult classes once a week just to do it again but I\u2019ll never get back to the level I was before and that makes me so sad because I worked so hard to get to that point. Losing interest in a hobby is normal but if you suddenly lose interest in a hobby that you really love and you can\u2019t explain why, don\u2019t be afraid to seek some help and counseling to help you work through it.",

Make it inviting and calmly stimulating to all your senses. \n(Edible smells, comforting smells to *you*, different pleasant textures, gently firm borders on all sides and also, weight on top of you (safely) Make sure your feet will be encapsulated in your wrappings, but safely.

In this safe place, *Each choice you make is a hug you are giving yourself.* No need to second guess yourself in a hug-fort. \n \nI\u2019ve stuffed a bulky coat or jacket and hugged it before, if that helps, also. \n\nNow, in your fort, think of all the people here who sent you hugs. Imagine all of us laughing and doing the squeeze-the-bread hug, release, squeeze, release...\nImagine us all doing a conga line and hugging. Doing the bunny hop and hugging. Imagine us all just gently draping an arm over each other, so comfortable with each other that the only sound is soft intakes and exhales of air. \n\nAll this that you imagine is actually  truth.

On my good days, when I deliberately center myself and fight the confusion and the panic, I am able to calm down and focus and get a lot more out of my time.

Not much in my social life but that was okay with me. I was sleepy but I felt good about it, I always got everything done when I said I would. But sometime in college I started not being able to do more than one productive thing a day basically. If I clean my house I didn\u2019t do homework, if I went to class, I didn\u2019t clean my house. My last semester I had to start working and even tho it was a stupid easy job it would knock all energy and motivation out of me and I had to pretty much scare myself straight with the reality of my financial position and shame myself by thinking of how embarrassing it would be not to graduate to finally finish my thesis project I\u2019d already delayed graduation for. I had a side job doing social media and I flaked too many times to count cause I had to prioritize my other job and I just couldn\u2019t handle both no matter how much *time* I technically had. and now after graduating I\u2019m working a new job that I truly enjoy but I\u2019m not full time yet. So I\u2019m working maybe 20 hours a week, I don\u2019t do the other job anymore, no school. Just maybe 4 hours of work a day (admittedly it\u2019s not an easy job but cmon 4 hours?) and cleaning my house. And I still find myself exhausted!  I really need to go full time and hopefully I will in the next few weeks, and at that time while my financial stress will go away, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m gonna get worse mentally /burn out because I can\u2019t handle it.

My daily life is thinking about how I'm not cut out to support myself and if my fiancee breaks up with me I would have nothing to do except move into my moms house or go to a homeless shelter because I can't go back to work and I cant work as hard as I'm required to in order to support myself, and I will never be independent and I will never get a salary job and I will never have any accomplishment again to celebrate for myself and I will never be able to live without depending on someone to help me get out of bed or to help me pay my bills. Everybody in my life is encouraging me to forgive myself and to not be so hard on myself, my fiancee reassures me that he has no desire to leave me, he told me it's okay that I can't go back to work right now (when I lost my job in March it was because my job went on strike at the same time that I had pneumonia and they made me come into work with pneumonia and a mask and a fever before I got tested for COVID so my coworkers went on strike and advocated for me while I was home sick, but if the virus never happened and my job never went on strike, I would still be jobless because I was fainting every day at work and throwing up at work and there were times I had to leave work early and go to the ER and I was progressively less and less able to handle it every day) and that I need to be at home focusing on my health, but I am constantly upset that I don't contribute to the house and that my fiancee could find someone who can work and does contribute and also that I can't do it by myself and I will never be the successful person I hoped I would be. But I'm learning to forgive myself and be kind to myself and just thank myself for doing my best right now, and I think that maybe if you replace \"I can't handle all this work,\" with \"thanks, me, for tolerating this much given the circumstances\" maybe you'll feel less overwhelmed and more just comfortable with the amount of stuff you can handle, even if it's different than your coworkers. The hardest thing for me is not comparing myself to those who I think are better than me, I still struggle with that even to this day. But it's important to remember that your strengths are not the same strengths your coworkers have and that's perfectly valid. Think about if your friend felt the way you feel, and tell yourself what you would tell your friend if your friend came to you feeling like this.

        "3917": "Thanks. I appreciate your kind words. As I've aged, I've definitely noticed I can't force myself to do certain things... I'm definitely too harsh on myself about it though. \n\nI have to try to constantly remind myself that I can't master/learn/juggle everything at once..",
        "3918": "I definitely set my standards too high. Right now I am learning about 6 new hobbies/skills. Meanwhile I am slow at work so I beat myself up for not being able to figure out all these things while simultaneously being a productive employee... I unintentionally drive myself crazy with my high expectations.\n\nI like being left alone too.. The major thing that triggered this post this morning was that we are doing a \"Weekly Spotlight\" at work where we highlight what a random staff member is doing at work and I am disappointed and anxious about it because I've been very slow at work lately... I work Support so when there aren't many support requests I just chill. Tbh, I get paid for 40 hours a week and work a maximum of 10 when I'm this slow.",
        "3919": "Thanks. Comparison does kill. I got off of social media about a month ago for this very reason. At work, they started doing a weekly spotlight of one employee each week where they fill us in on all the work they're doing. I think a lot of my insecurities are coming from this...  It's a company email sent out weekly so it isn't really avoidable. I think I just need to try not to read it/compare myself to it every Monday..\n\nI know I do \"a lot\" compared to others, but sometimes it is easy to get in the mindframe that you always need to \"do more\" no matter how much you are already doing.. I need to remember that I am doing enough for ME and that my expectations can be unrealistic sometimes.",
        "3920": "That's very interesting to hear. My sister actually has schizophrenia and autism. I'm not familiar with schizoaffective, but it sounds hard to manage. I would definitely say I have depression tendencies. I don't know about anything beyond that.\n\nI never considered that working more/doing more truly can very from person to person depending on their mental health situation. I've had a really hard past so I'm guessing that could be part of my \"inability\" to work or handle as much as others.\n\nThanks for sharing. I feel better after reading this.",
        "3921": "Thanks for the positive vibes. I certainly agree that everyday life is unnatural and uncomfortable. I guess the fakeness of life bothers me as well.",
        "3922": "Dang, I'm sorry. If you ever wanna vent or anything feel free to PM me about it. I tend to do the same thing. I don't have many friends/family IRL so I just come to the internet/strangers when I am falling apart lol.",
        "3923": "I understand. I actually have a degree in Civil Engineering that I don't use anymore. I worked in the Civil Eng field for 3 years. I had 4 different jobs in that time period. I hated them all with the last job being THE WORST. (no exaggeration, they were micromanagers from hell).\n\nUnfortunately, our society does not help you envision what it's like to have a full time position in your future field. They only give you the loans and allow you to sign up for the classes. I just made the best \"logical\" decision I could which was to go for a degree in a stable market that would make decent money. Hopefully you don't regret your degree too much, but if you do, I understand. It feels really shitty to be stuck with a degree you don't like.",
        "3924": "Thanks. Yes, it's terrible that some people feel like they have to keep themselves that busy. Fortunately, I don't have to go to those lengths.. \n\nThis culture is definitely toxic for so many reasons. It's very unrealistic because we expect people to be able to juggle so many tasks/objectives yet remain perfectly fine with no mental health issues..",
        "3925": "I felt the same way when I worked minimum wage retail. I worked at Old Navy for 3-4 years. I would purposely ask off days/weekends before tests to allow myself to study for exams. I guess I wasn't very good at working to begin with. Now that I've been in the workforce for 4 years, it is becoming more and more clear. \n\nI can handle my current job situation alright, but it will probably exhaust me eventually. Good luck with your current job situation.",
        "3926": "That's how I get too... Some days I am satisfied with less than others. Some days I generate so much \"work\" for myself that I don't relax at all.. I'm trying to find the balance",
        "3927": "Thanks for sharing. I get paid for 40 hours and only work about 10 hours (lately) or less due to lack of work. I work support so if there aren't many support requests, I don't do anything.\n\nThis has been feeding my anxiety quite a bit because I always feel guilty that I can't handle more in my down time.. But also anxiety because I'm not doing more at work. A lot of my coworkers do \"professional development\" such as software training in their down time.. I just do household chores, read about hobbies, etc. since I work from home. Idk it's hard for me to feel content with anything I do.",
        "3928": "I resonate with this one.. I hate to be comparing or anything, but I honestly don't know anyone who relates to some of my struggles. I have to stop being so hard on myself.",
        "3929": "Thanks. That was really sweet of you to say. I'm so sorry to hear that you're struggling with self love as well. It is so incredibly hard to love and accept ourselves in this day and age of selfies and superficiality. It is so easy to feel inadequate or unlovable because someone else is so much \"better\" or whatever it is.\n\nWe all have our different backgrounds and struggles and I have to remember that not everyone has it as easy as it seems.\n\nI'm 27. My mom moved to the Philippines when I graduated from college at 23. I saw my mom for a couple days in 2016 before she moved and a couple more days in 2018 when she came to visit the states. I have not seen a family member since then. My entire side of mom's family lives in the Philippines. I don't keep in touch with my dad's side of the family because they are \"crazy.\" Hell, even he didn't want to keep in touch with them. My dad died when I was 16. I guess my major struggle in life is my utter loneliness. I think that loneliness makes me feel unlovable/unworthy due to the love I never received from family. I'm trying to work on my self love as well.\n\nI really appreciate you sharing your struggles with me. I think that it really helps to hear what other people are struggling with too. Just to feel more human and feel like other people are more human too.",
        "3930": "Yes, I definitely do that sometimes. Typically it is I'm smarter or I'm just better at decision making than someone. Other times it's because I look better or take care of myself (fitness) better.\n\nThere's certainly something egoic and unhealthy about feeling better than others, but it does happen from time to time. It's good that you're at least aware of when you are doing it so that you can try to correct that thought process.\n\nWe should really be looking at each other as human beings. We all come from the same mold. There's technically no \"better\" or \"worse\" people from a true unbiased perspective. We are all the same.",
        "3931": "I burn out pretty quick too.. Life is exhausting. Try not to think of it as your shortcomings, this is really an issue with our society/system.\n\nEvolutionarily we were not sitting at desks doing boring busy work 40+ hours a week lol. Ultimately, the system we came up with is pretty meaningless. All we really need is food/water, shelter, and health. We don't really have to do any of this BS, we just agree to it. I think that this is the true reason why I'm so fast to burn out. Maybe it's the same for you too. Realistically, I would like to live in a commune and just do my job and live lol.",
        "3932": "You probably don't believe them because you don't value yourself/your feelings. I think that it is very possible that someone could be worried about you. It sounds like you may even need to be worried about yourself.\n\nDo you know the person well? Are they someone you like to share your feelings with? You also may just have problems trusting said person because you don't know them well enough. Would it change the situation if it was someone else who said they were worried about you? Would you be more/less trusting?",
        "3933": "Well, if you ever want to share, feel free to PM me. I am very non-judgmental so I wouldn't think twice about whatever is bothering you.",
        "3934": "Yeah, I think that I need to see a therapist to really figure out my mental health.. I've never really went to a therapist regularly for an extended period of time. My first therapist SUUUUCKED. My second therapist was good, but I moved away and lost coverage with that provider.\n\nI think I need to try again.. they always ay 'third times a charm'",
        "3935": "Most likely both. I'm in the same boat although I've never been diagnosed with any mental illness.. but I've also only been to a therapist a handful of times.",
        "3936": "Sometimes it's harder than other times.. Hopefully you are feeling better now/today than you did when you responded. Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk about it at all.",
        "3937": "Do you need to get a new job? Do you need to work in a new field? Or are you just going to feel this way regardless of what you do for work?\n\nI only ask because I was in the Civil Eng. field for 3 years. I tried 4 different jobs. I have a Civil Eng. degree... I fucking hated it. I eventually just had to quit my last job, and I haven't done Civil Eng. since.  I was absolutely miserable and anxious. My weekends were painful because all I could do was try not to worry about working again.. I couldn't sleep at night.\n\nI switched fields (software support for engineering software) and I feel a lot better than I used to. It's not ideal, but it's definitely an improvement.",
        "3938": "I think I like to keep myself busy doing my own things to help me cope. Working doesn't help at all.. Working feels overwhelming because it is unrelatable and mostly bullshit. I think that if I worked in a field that I really connected to I would feel a lot better, but I don't know how I would make that happen.\n\nI legitimately should probably see a therapist. I think that's what I'm really getting from your response and other's. I had a really shitty childhood followed by a very isolated/lonely adulthood.",
        "3939": "It comes and goes.. I have times where I can't even remember what it's like to be happy or what happiness is like. I will feel so down on myself and everything will feel incredibly overwhelming. I get to a point where I can't even make decisions anymore. Simple/meaningless decisions will feel huge. \n\nI'm sorry you feel that way. I know it is probably hard dealing with it for so long, but it sounds like you have been working on this for a while now so at least you are trying to address it. I am going to start trying therapy again too.. This will be my third try.",
        "3940": "Damn.. I hope that you're not on social media. I deleted social media about a month ago. Obviously I'm not doing amazing, hence the anxious/overwhelmed post, but I am doing quite a bit better than before.\n\nI had a tendency to compare myself to people far too much and social media was very distracting. I couldn't keep my train of thought and would often find myself looking for distractions. I can maintain more focus lately since deleting it. Also I am generally comparing myself to people a lot less without Facebook & Instagram. I would recommend deleting those things if you have them. Even things that didn't necessarily hurt me, were still hurting me. The politics, the bickering, etc.. It's just not a great environment.",
        "3941": "Haha I appreciate your humor. I deleted FB/instagram a month ago which helped a lot.\n\nI try to do those things, but sometimes I am juggling a lot so it gets overwhelming. I appreciate your friendly reminders.. I need to get back into meditation and more yoga.",
        "3942": "> I\u2019m sure that there are somethings you can do better than me and vice versa. But why does it matter? We have a different set of tools because we\u2019ve been hammering away at a dissimilar set of problems. So in this sense, it\u2019s not that everyone is handling life \u201dbetter than you\u201d, they are handling it differently. Your issue is that you are so busy admiring the life of others that you for whatever reason forget as to how amazing you are. Don\u2019t do that to yourself \ud83d\ude21\n\nI appreciate it. It is hard to remember this in the moment.. I always forget how amazing I am. Not in an egotistical way, but much like you said, I have went through some crazy shit and I am handling it in my own way, the best I can, which is amazing.\n\n> I hoped this helped. Take care of yourself person\n\nIt did help. This reminds me of why I removed myself from social media (minus Reddit). I was doing too much comparing and not enough self appreciation. I've heard of people doing gratitude exercises.. I think I should start doing those.",
        "3943": "I\u2019m sorry your motivation has been affected by the providers you\u2019ve tried to interact with so far. Please don\u2019t stop looking if possible! I tried all sorts of resources and types of providers before I found my current therapist. (Been my provider for 4 years now). Finding my current therapist made the previous search and slog feel all the more worth it.  It\u2019s totally ok to try people with different clinical backgrounds and it\u2019s understandable to ask for a different practitioner. Sometimes people just aren\u2019t a good fit.",
        "3944": "Thank you!",
        "3945": "Hi, thanks for your reply. I don't wait to find a right job actually, I did it before and also tried to convince myself what you just said but I get my mechanism running in different principle, I can not do anything if I don't feel it genuinely, I can not spend 8 hours/day doing something that I don't really care and subsequently I know it affect other and damaging my seft-esteem. It not only hurt me, it hurt other and it has been proven strongly. For me, work is not just work, it can be not fun and nice, but at least, I have to feel it valueable.\n\nSorry, I'm kind of obstinate. All the best for you!",
        "3946": "I sometimes tend to set unrealistic goals for myself, yes. But I don't think a goal like \"practice your drawing skills for 30 minutes a day\" is that unrealistic but, like every task, it takes me about 4 hours to start doing something that takes 30 minutes.",
        "3947": "Lol I\u2019ve been to two therapists, I wish I could say it helped",
        "3948": "I feel like that too. I'm taking online classes right now and it's really difficult to get into a good work ethic especially when i can just cheat on most things. People in the discords i frequent for school seem like they have everything under control and everything's easy but i try to just excuse that as them being tryhards. Good for them they're able to get so much work done but at the end of the day I'd be more happy if I could just sit and play games online with my friends rather than study all night.",
        "3949": "Yes - schizoaffective can have less destructive psychosis but tend more toward comorbidity with personality disorders and depression, anxiety. \n\nPersonally I'm willing to take the hit in income if it means I can handle myself better. It might even put in the end in terms of costing me less in meds, or self-medication expenses...\n\nAnyway glad this helped! Everyone has to figure out how to best care for themselves and there should be flexibility there.",
        "3950": "Thanks.  I think my issue might be different from yours.  In your case, it may just be a case of \u201ceveryone is different\u201d, or people are just dealing with different issues behind the scenes. Yeah some people can handle way more stuff at one time.  I see this all of the time, and I am definitely on the low end of my team on this.  On the other hand, you can probably handle much more than other people would in your situation.  In my case, we try to hire new people for my group and they often don\u2019t cut it, or some of the new employees that stay end up not carrying much of a load.  I can look at those employees and see that I handle much more.  It\u2019s not hard to find people that can do more or less than I can, so I guess it is all relative.\n\nMy issue is definitely depression and anxiety, and I feel like it has chipped away at my mind over the years where I don\u2019t think I can handle it all anymore.  I need to make a change but I also afraid to that.  If I can\u2019t handle my current job, will I be able to handle a new situation?",
        "3951": "Unless one of your goals is to move up the ladder, and that goal outweighs other goals you are actively working on I don\u2019t think you should feel guilty about doing things you enjoy rather than professional development shit. If that\u2019s what they value, that\u2019s wonderful for them but if that\u2019s not what you want to put your time into there\u2019s no reason to do it. My goal is to have a job where I come home and I\u2019m done so I can paint or play animal crossing or read a book when I get home. My goal right now is not to juggle lots of things cause that doesn\u2019t make me happy in the slightest anymore. So if you feel restless, id suggest  doing more things you enjoy, it doesn\u2019t have to be productive by capitalistic standards to make you feel productive and better. When I was furloughed from covid I got that kinda unproductive anxiety but it was because I was just sleeping and watching Netflix. When I did things I actively enjoyed, like doing my nails or art or going for walks and taking pictures, I get a reprieve from that guilt anxiety.",
        "3952": "I also think about every person on the street and every other person in my life is just a normal person with a happy life and of course they wear clean clothes and they shower normally and they have a balanced work/social life and they don't do self-destructive things and they have a standard level of self-respect, but honestly all those people are, for the most part, on TV and any person you see walk past you on the street is not that perfect, so it's unrealistic for you and me to also have those standards for ourselves even if they are technically healthy goals. Family is important to have close to you and it's really really hard to have a relationship with your parents and they aren't there. I moved 10 miles away from my mom and I'm an adult man now and I wasn't close with my Mom growing up so I would never really classify myself as a \"momma's boy\" too much, or at least I wouldn't have growing up, but I think often \"I want my mom right now\" and I always think about what I'm going to do if she dies before I do. I couldn't imagine how hard it is for someone to be going through what you are and not have family as part of your close support network. You seem like a very strong person, especially with all things considered, and I don't think anyone can blame you for feeling these feelings. In the middle of a pandemic and nationwide protests, all you can do is your best, and to me from an outside perspective it sounds like you're doing your very best. We're all human, you included, and your feelings are valid.",

I personally want to try therapy again soon (this will be my third try).\n\nDo you have any particular changes in mind? \n\nI personally had to quit my last job without another one lined up because it fucked me up so badly. I have a Civil Eng. degree so I worked in the field for 3 years after graduation. I had 4 different jobs in that time span. Each job and work environment progressively got worse (for different reasons). I eventually had to quit the field and get out of it. I wasn't sleeping, I was dreading my work week to the point where it made my weekends and week nights unenjoyable, etc.. I have felt significantly better after getting out of that field.\n\nAnother change I've made is deleting Facebook and Instagram. That one helped a lot too.",

It\u2019s just not an easy thing to do.\n\nI\u2019m in accounting and I\u2019ve been doing it a long time.  I\u2019ve been in my current job for almost 10 years and I am paid well, so it\u2019s a very big decision.  My job clearly makes me unhappy on many levels, but I always decide it would be best to keep it and try to make changes like medication to make it more tolerable.  And of course that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBack to your original post - I got an audit request today and I just about had a mental breakdown.  I\u2019m working on it now, but I have to convince myself most days that I can keep going.

        "3973": "I agree I watched a YouTube video from a woman name Kati Morton who\u2019s a licensed therapist who broached on the topic of 13 reasons why and why she felt like it was a bad show and one point that I thought she made very well was that shows often times tend to romanticize suicide like it\u2019s a beautiful thing when in actuality it\u2019s awful and nothing about it is good I think shows like this are giving young people the wrong idea because what this show is promoting is not only the romantic aspect but also anger and revenge the need to get back at others who hurt us instead of acting taking an more productive manner and teaching others about awareness overall I think they could have taken this shown in another direction",
        "3974": "medical professionals agree with you. some actually said the things did in this show were things they told the crew not to do when they were consulted.\n\nif you're suicidal or depressed, don't watch that show. it does everything wrong in terms of avoiding triggering a MI episode.",
        "3975": "I started watching 13RW but didn't finish the first season. However, I read the book. As far as I know, they completely changed Hannah's suicide scene so it would be more shocking, and although they removed (did they?) that part after all the controversy it caused, I think they should have been more careful in the first place. Suicide is a sensitive topic and not everyone can write about it. We need to stop romanticising suicide and mental health issues and TV-series shouldn't portray them as something glamorous. They are not, and these scenes don't help, they can be triggering.",
        "3976": "I worked at a mental health clinic and a client watched this and it triggered more anxiety attacks, flashbacks, thoughts of harming herself and I\u2019m not sure on all the exacts but it was the OPPOSITE of helpful. I\u2019ve had a problem with this movie ever since, never read the book but haven\u2019t wanted to.",
        "3977": "It was universally condemned by medical professionals. It's actually why the show was cancelled because it lead to a spike in teen suicide attempts.\n\nhttps://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(19)30288-6/fulltext",
        "3978": "I hated how they made her suicide like a revenge plot against the people who wronged her. It also made her suicide to be this thing that can be easily explained by bad life events. Bad trauma isn't the only cause of suicide. It is also combined with mental illness and a severe chemical imbalance in the brain. Like it never really felt like I was watching someone who was depressed. Also in the second season clay keeps seeing her and talking to her, and it made it seem like she wasn't really gone. But suicide ends everything, you dont get to see the aftermath. Also what they did with Tyler was fucking terriable. He almost shoots up a dance. But clay runs in front of him and talks him out of it and the friend group decides to watch over him at all times instead of turning him into the police.",
        "3979": "This show came out during a time I was suicidal, dealing with my anxiety disorder, and battling severe depression. I was having panic attacks everyday. I knew that it showed a suicide and I refused to watch it because a lot of my anxiety revolved around me having suicidal thoughts. Everyday at school people would talk about it and it triggered a panic attack every time. FUCK this show.",
        "3980": "I was 16 when it came out and I watched the whole thing in one sitting. I was completely out of touch with reality after that. I started planning my death and become obsessed with \u201cleaving a message\u201d behind for those who had hurt me. even though I\u2019m constantly dissociated now I\u2019ve never felt out of touch to that extent",
        "3981": "The show was horrid. They went against what clinical psychiatrists said. it took them 2 years to remove the suicide scene but they kept in liek 4 r*** scenes...",
        "3982": "I personally was disturbed by it as it was focused and aimed at youth, who make such impulsive decisions already, due to lack of maturity.\n\nExamples of unhappy situations leading to a the taking of one's life is irresponsible and teaches NOTHING.\n\nBetter that they show the successes of how time and support and maturity will solve most of these teenage angst issues.",
        "3983": "I hated it, I watched it while i was not in the best place and i truly hated the way it romanticises suicide and drops everything on the fault side. Also heard about the second season: put every 'hot' or highly debated topic and mix it together to get views, that's not how you make series, and I'm sure that's not how you spread awareness.",
        "3984": "I\u2019ve lost almost everyone I\u2019ve ever loved or been friends with. Various causes but the hardest are the suicides because you\u2019re left wondering if there was anything you could have done different to stop them and help them feel better. \n\nThe worst one for me was the very first boy I ever dated. We were no older than like 11 when we went on our first date. Obviously we broke up and went on with life but we always remained extremely close friends. Even in adulthood and even though e we really only got to talk every so many months. \n\nA week before my birthday he had invited me and my significant other at the time, out to this cabin he bought with his wife for a weekend trip. Which would coincide with my birthday and we had a really great weekend planned. He had just finished making a huge batch of mead.\n\nThe day before the trip another friend called me to gently let me know he had shot himself in the early morning hours. No one wanted to tell me because everyone knows the amount of loss I\u2019ve endured throughout my life. Scared I would snap I guess. Not gonna lie. The last time I had cried or felt anything upon the news of the death of a loved one was easily years prior. You get numb to it when it happens all the time. \n\nWith him? It was immediately like someone punched me in the solar plexus. The air was literally knocked out of me. I also knew exactly how it went down before I was told. This guy was a pretty wild dude. Tons of energy and a total adrenaline junkie. When I was told he short himself the first thing I asked was:\n\nHow many bullets did they find in the chamber?\n\nNo one knew until days later but I was correct in my thinking. There was only one bullet in total. None were left in the chamber. He was playing Roulette. We could never figure out what prompted him to do it or how many times he pulled the trigger. Did he just keep pulling until it was over? Or was it an accident on the first try? \n\nAnyway my point is I had started watching this show before realizing what it was and upon realizing what it was I got physically sick to my stomach. It\u2019s almost as if they are kind of glorifying the act. \n\nI\u2019m not against ending ones own life in regards to incurable and debilitating disease. I\u2019m all for the end of life act, I watched my mother die slowly and in agonizing pain literally begging the nurses to overdose her towards the last few months. I do find it beyond tragic when the young feel like they have no other recourse than to end their own lives.",
        "3985": "That show was special to me due to (in hindsight, unlrelated) personal circumstances around the release of the first season. Now that I'm over those circumstances, I've started seeing the show for what it really is.\n\nIt's not a romance drama. It's not a teenage love story. It's a really slippery slope that you have to have a REALLY open mindset before watching. Anything else and you're definitely gonna get the wrong message from it. And no, the warning they added isn't enough to deal with the fact that the show's basically an advertisement for suicide.\n\nIt's a really serious story that people HAVE to have an open mind to be watching.",
        "3986": "This show was critiqued heavily when it came out and still is. It completely breaks media guidelines for representing suicide\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[http://www.suicide.org/media-guidelines-for-suicide.html](http://www.suicide.org/media-guidelines-for-suicide.html)",
        "3987": "It assumes the most frustrating question: \"why?\"\n\n\"Why?\" is not a helpful question. \"Why?\" presumes someone has fault. \"Why?\" presumes understanding of your negative feelings. \"Why?\" presumes that there is something to fix.",

Ugh it just makes me feel like shit yknow? You don\u2019t need to have a reason to be suicidal some people just are and it\u2019s a shame but  unfortunately that\u2019s how the world works",
        "3994": "Actually correlated with increasing suicide rates.",

        "3996": "I remember when it aired there was a lot of controversy around it. I never watched it but my girlfriend did and was telling me about how awful it could be. Prompted me to make this: [https://youtu.be/qbOWGl--m0I](https://youtu.be/qbOWGl--m0I) , as I was watching A Series of Unfortunate Events at the time and thought the song was fitting. \"Ask any stable person should I watch and they will say 'look away, look away!\"",
        "3997": "Not to mention that for about 1 week after the show was released suicide rates got higher. Mental health professionals on the set advised against adding in certain scenes but the producers did it anyway, and they only took them out after these statistics became more well known.",
        "3998": "My sister was really suicidal when she watched that show, the warnings never helped and I had to talk her out of suicide. I think it\u2019s an abomination to the mental health community and shouldn\u2019t even be up. I hate that show to it\u2019s core.",
        "3999": "My therapist told me straight up not to watch it.",
        "4000": "It was horrific.\n\nThe book was great, the girl was NOT painted in a good light, it was a story where she may have been pushed over the edge due to others, but she put blame onto many, some that was very justified and others less so.\n\nJust know, I havent read the book for 7 years now, but the little I saw from the show and the subsequent reviews- it ROMANTICIZED SUICIDE.\n\nLook, if you are put into a situation such as her, you are generally not at fault whatsoever. But you cannot expect others to act for you. You are responsible for yourself, if you are unwilling to act for yourself, fight for yourself, then you can't expect others to do so.\n\nThe show should have done this: 1 prequel, where she was alive. Then her subsequent death. Afterwords they should have never shown her again: That is what death is. One second a live, breathing human with millions of memories- the next they are gone, no redo's. They are gone. \n\nSure, it is more difficult to make a compelling narrative- but writing isn't easy, and the final product should not be one that is so god damn harmful and shows the complete opposite of what the message should be.",
        "4001": "The suicide rate increased so much, that\u2019s actually very sad. Especially since the whole producers and actors said they are spreading awareness but they just worsened the problem.\nI wonder if they even feel any guilt about it",
        "4002": "I liked the first season. Thought they lessened the effect of the harsh reality by making more. I didn't feel like they were trying to make suicide beautiful. But it definitely did nothing to raise awareness",

        "4004": "[Yep.](https://youtu.be/tfzx86mp83Q)",
        "4005": "I think the only \"good\" thing that the show did was to get people to start talking about mental illness and suicide. Although I do not think it was in the right way, I know that the show helped break down some of the awkwardness or taboo toward suicide. I 10000% agree that the show was crap and portrayed depression and suicide in the completely wrong way.",
        "4006": "My little sister was maybe 14/15 when she started watching it at my house. She had heard about it from her friends, it was trendy thing to watch among them at the time. Being 12 years older than her I have sort of a weird mix between a traditional sibling relationship and a parent-ish or aunt-ish type relationship with my sister I guess? I of course am the responsible person when she's at my house but I don't want her to feel like i'm parenting her or babysitting her or anything like that now that she's a teen. As her sister I just don't want to nag her or anything like that. \n\nBut with this show? I had such a hard time not preaching to her the whole time. I did make a few comments about some of the worst things I noticed, I just couldn't help myself - and thankfully she totally agreed with me and seemed to already take the same opinion as me without me even needing to point it out. Like how the kids seemed to be listening through the tapes in an attempt to figure out whose 'fault' the suicide was and how wrong it is to see suicide as something to blame on any individual. So that made me hopeful that some other teens were able to see through the worst parts of it too. But it was rough to watch and we didn't even get to the \"bath tub scene\" that i've seen referenced online.",
        "4007": "Completely agreed.  I have struggled with depression, anxiety and all that goes with it for years.  A friend wanted me to watch with her.  I only made it to episode 4 and about 10 minutes in ... i was aware of the feelings they were portraying that\u2019s for sure.  She bagged me for months to finish watching and I finally had to lay it out for her that I just couldn\u2019t do it.",
        "4008": "Book is better",
        "4009": "I found that really irresponsible of the producers and everyone involved with promotion - To suggest it was about bringing awareness. Among many other issues the show has when looked at from that point of view It also implies you, the deceased, will get some sort of closure if you leave enough notes (tapes), when in reality very little would come from said letters and regardless you, the deceased, will not know one way or another. Had they not gone the rout of promoting it brining awareness I wouldn\u2019t care one way or another about the show but I think it\u2019s really misleading and damaging, especially to younger people.",
        "4010": "Agreed. I watched I think 4 episodes and went into a bad depressive mood. I stopped watching it just cause it made everything worse.",
        "4011": "Thankfully never watched this show. Heard all these reviews and how complicated the message was. I think people don't get the message though. After this show was released it changed a lot of views on mental health, generated conversation in a young generation.",
        "4012": "1000% agree and has since the first season came out",
        "4013": "Same thoughts as you. \n\nFor people who are already suffering from depression, this show may have just shoved them to doing something devastating. Giving them the idea of committing suicide (ie. how Hannah died) as a form of escaping the pain, and a meaning for them to do so (to incite regrets and guilt amongst people who may have directly/indirectly led them to their eventual decision). \n\nTerrible for people who are already suffering from mental health issues in general. \n\nI would rather have a show where it shows how a person recovers from depression instead.",
        "4014": "It's just a dumb drama for people to gawk at",
        "4015": "I completely agree with this. The show makes suicide out to be \u201cthe ultimate revenge,\u201d when in reality, continuing to thrive and live your life despite the shitty hand that\u2019s been dealt to you, is way better revenge than taking the easy way out. I know this first hand.",
        "4016": "Agreed. The more I watch Netflix the more I'm beginning to feel disgusted at their nonexistent ethical compass. I'm not saying we should promote censorship at all, but some stuff should at least be labeled with more warnings that the content is wrongfully portrayed. (Calling the kettle black but it's better than nothing). Like, tiger king is super fascinating, but feels lousy to earn so many bucks on human derrangement, the horrible show of gyneth paltrow is NOT scientific at all, there are usually lots of factual errors in netflix documentaries etc etc.",
        "4017": "This is why I\u2019ve never watched it",
        "4018": "I fully agree. Also, the show lacks subtlety because so many people in it suffer from all these extreme things that happen to them. Like you cant be depressed without getting bullied, abused or raped.",
        "4019": "That show came out forever ago are people still talking about it. If not Why bother",
        "4020": "I watched s1 with good mental health and it made me very unsettled and I stopped.\n\nInsatiable also postures about dealing with overweight teen issues when it\u2019s just mindless entertainment for profit.\n\nNetflix shows stop having false pretenses of altruism and just admit to being a form of passing time when its 10pm on a weeknight",

        "4027": "I like the show. Regarded of what you think. The show has gotten you talking about it and the messages it is sending and ultimately that is getting people talking about mental health which is a good thing.",
        "4028": "They really shouldn\u2019t be promoting it as something to \u201craise awareness\u201d and \u201cspread the message\u201d. The way they\u2019re selling it as some sort of suicide awareness thing is sickening.",

Ive never been triggered like that before.  I wouldnt even say that I was even ever *that* close to ending it, but a lot of my childhood consisted of me in a depressive and suicidal state.

It was actually about 5 weeks in that I realized my boyfriend back home was abusive and at the time he was my only escape from my even more abusive family. The last two weeks abroad I fell so hard from the fear of having to go back and face it all after feeling so free. I also went in with one friend and a few acquaintances, no one that really knew who I really was before, which was definitely nice. I had a group bonded by being the only ones in the area who could speak English \ud83d\ude02\n\nToday I wish I could run away almost all the time. I no longer live with my family, but I do live with that same boyfriend. I'm looking at grad schools for my next escape. The only real concern I have is whether running is just anxious avoidance or a clean break. I don't want to spend my life running when things get too hard. I just also don't want to stick around and get walked all over and continue to ingest the toxic, petty, and immature atmosphere that roll off these people in waves",

In other words, unless you build some boundaries and set standards of behavior for yourself and the people you bring into your life, nothing will change. \n\nGhosting on everyone means that, at least initially, you're completely isolated. Quarantine has nothing on it. And if you're not mentally prepared for the shift in reality, you're going to get very depressed very quickly. \n\nSo it's a nice fantasy when things get bad.

        "4123": "I've done that, kind of. \n\nI lived in Chicago in my 20s, and had a good group of friends there, nice apartment, got comfortable. But I changed a lot during my time there, and my friendships didn't make me feel good anymore. I kind of realized I had been living to \"keep up with the Joneses\" and therefore my friendships just didn't have the substance I wanted. I also realized I had forgotten about my two big goals: to travel, and eventually to save enough money to buy land someplace cheap and live a simple life. So I saved up and left for a 14 month international trip, and never moved back to Chicago. I kind of used the distance and the trip to end the last few friendships that still lingered. \n\nThough you can physically move away from people and situations, they still exist in your mind. I still feel hurt over the best friend that dumped me for superficial reasons. And I still feel bad for intentionally \"losing touch\" with some friends. And I'm still working on improving the insecurities that led to me having shitty friendships to begin with. However the space definitely gave me room to grow and change.  I emotionally matured, learned to communicate better & more honestly, and learned to allow myself to be the imperfect-but-trying human that I am. I learned how I wanted to connect with people (more authenticity, supportive, understanding), and the friendships I've made since then are so much deeper - albeit few in number. I don't have friends that make me feel bad about who I am, and I also know not to allow that dynamic in my life anymore. \n\nI'm still very much figuring it out. I think if I learned some of these things, I could have improved my situation in Chicago without essentially ghosting people. I could have had honest, compassionate conversations, and allowed my friends' reactions to determine if we could evolve together as friends or part our own ways.

Social media accounts, websites, high school diplomas - the list goes on and on. So be careful what you wish for!\n\nHowever I do connect with the rest of your fantasy. Sometimes I feel like it would be fun to start completely afresh. Making a living as a writer is hard and sometimes I do wish I could just try something different.

I for instance eat an awful diet with a huge ice cream per day, a whole 1 liter of the most sugary flavors, plus one big bag of chips, fried corn, very bad junk food and it helps me a lot to feel good.

Without the follow up you provided, it's easy to assume your advice is just another throwaway line from someone who can't empathize with people in this subreddit.\n\nSo since I do still agree with the initial assertion that going for a walk -can- help (not all, but maybe more than less), I'd actually like to bother you to make a new topic and share your expertise. \n\nCite sources, relevant quotes, studies, and tests performed. Create a post with irrefutable evidence of the benefits of going for a walk. While it may not apply to everyone, there are enough depressed people here with the resistance to the idea of ever getting better, and reading a post that challenges their core ideals on the subject may be enough to get them up and walking, which might not help, but is a first step towards positive changes they can make.\n\nCause trust me. This post gets posted every single day, multiple times a day, and is met with the same skepticism and criticism.

Im currently going through seasonal Depression or to be more specific, im having personal anger against the fact, that im supposed to work from 8am to 5pm, mon-fri... then i need to get to work and from work home, do household, do Hygiene, eat. So in the end its not much time per day that i have for myself and especially things that bring me joy (hobbies). I leave for work when  its dark outside, i come home when its dark outside.(at least during Winter ) Meaning i have to face the fact that if i have some free hours to really live , im probably tired af and cant give it my full Potential into my hobbies and stuff im passionate about. You can guess where this is going towards already; so one day not long ago, the initial thought hit me unexpected during daydreaming: i will not accept all this without at least a compromise, so i decided to take my \"Me-Time\" by force and just do whatever i really want until im really tired and able to accept going to sleep. \nMy final thought on this: its darkest before the dawn; and since i noticed how understanding and beautifully quiet the night is, i try to hold Back the day as much/often as possible.  The price i pay is only a bit of my concentration due to shortened sleep. Luckily my job is not really hard and i have Methods(mentally) to get through my shift with a sort of ease, so its worth it. I can say i could have it worse but that alone doesnt make me feel better. I can say im still alive, but never ask me if i feel like im really living... \n\nThanks for reading in advance.

Not recommended XD So, we have to be judicious with tasks, because running out of spoons in the middle of the day could lead to you not having dinner, or not being able to pick up a buddy from work on time. Like do I really want to go brush my teeth if it means I deplete my spoons and don\u2019t get anything done for two hours after that? No, no I do not.

Crest mouthwash changes the pH balance in your mouth which makes it harder for bacteria to grow.\n\nI survived this, obviously, and the damage could have been much worse. But if you possibly can, clean your mouth.\n\nUse mouth wash. Brush your teeth. Use floss or a water pik (floss is better, water pik is easier... at least for me).

I used to try so hard and I'd lock myself in the bathroom until I had panic attacks and threw up. Putting the brush in my mouth would make me start sobbing and hyperventilating, it got so bad that I couldn't walk past the bathroom without getting nauseous or crying. I spent an entire year trying to work through it, my parents even tried behavioral therapy but all that accomplished was I'd get physically sick the day before the appointment and have debilitating stress migraines.\n\nIt feels like I'm making excuses and a lot of people have told me I gave up on the therapy too soon. I've been told a million times that if I just tried a little harder or been less stubborn then I wouldn't have this problem. Every single dentist I've seen has tried to drill scary facts into my head about how I'm ruining my future. I know all the risks and the consequences, all that does is stress me out and get panic attacks thinking about how I can't brush my teeth without getting panic attacks! \n\nIt doesn't help that none of their dire predictions have come true. I learn from cause and effect and so far nothing bad has happened. Every time I go to the dentist I ask them how much it looks like I brush my teeth. Every single one says something around afew times a week. I haven't touched a brush in almost 6 years and yet everything looks fine. I know you're probably thinking that's disgusting or unbelievable but other than flossing maybe like once a week, I haven't taken care of my teeth in years.\n\nI keep telling everyone that once something bad happens I'll listen to them but honestly I'm sure if I could do it even if my teeth were falling out. My parents pretty much gave up on making me when they found out that all those times I told them I brushed my teeth I only wet the brush and put a bit of toothpaste in my mouth so it'd smell like I did it. It seems so childish looking back, but I know I'd still be doing the same thing if they hadn't given up.\n\nI know this probably wasn't what you were referring to and it's likely I'm talking about a completely separate problem, but I figured I'd post this anyway and see if anyone else has gone through through the same thing.\n\n[I would like to explicitly state that I am by no means trying to say that its not necessary to brush your teeth, or that you'll be fine if you don't do it!!! I know I probably got something coming to me and I'm gonna have to accept the consequences of my actions probably sooner than later, so yeah. Ok I feel better now that I've said that.]",

Some families regardless of their religious beliefs feel shame when a loved one takes their own life.  It's quite common.  The question is why?  I think it has a lot to do with the general idea of \"I should have seen this coming\" or maybe they truly do feel culpable.  Really unless a person asks how another feels, we never truly know.  The parents are grieving in their own way, and maybe they haven't come to terms with the suicide part yet.  For some, suicide is still a personal and private struggle and they don't want it in the light, it is a difficult topic for sure.  \n\nMaybe for them it is more them wanting to cope with this idea of suicide of their loved one in private because they aren't ready to face it.  \n\nI don't want you to feel like I'm taking sides or that your feelings aren't valid.

Then depending on the size of the \"Cult\" there maybe a \"lost child\" who's just basically invisible in the cult and often labeled \"a little bit slow\" or some other sick tag to dismiss their relevance UNTIL the Scapegoat has enough and either does something drastic to escape like your dear cousin or they go \"no contact\" then they will \"dump\" that roll onto the lost child.\n\nAs terrible as it sounds she is in a far better place than she left due to the unbearable pressure of being brought up by these demonic scumbags can do to your mental health and I speak from 47 years of experience dealing with them myself and wish I had of had the information available then that I have now...How I am still here is nothing short of miraculous. I'm sure your cousin has now found the peace she wasn't allowed by her \"parents\".\n\n\\*On a final note I would urge anyone experiencing this type of pressure from their \"Parents\" TO GET OUT and GO NO CONTACT as soon as you possibly can or I promise they will either put you in an early grave or in my own case destroy your life.\\*",

None of her loved ones really thought this was happening, and now they all wish they could have been there to do something about it. \n\nProbably, she gave everyone who actually loves her a vicious case of PTSD where they will play the scene over and over in their minds and have fantasies about what they could have done, and now it's too late. \n\nMeanwhile, religious people know you go to hell for killing yourself. \n\nSo, you want them to focus on all of that shit? \n\nPeople want it to just go away. \n\nIn addition, once someone commits suicide in a family, it tends to spread like a disease, and more suicides happen.

Lazy on the weekends after you've worked? I think you mean to say you're tired and burnt out from working all week. There's always a REASON behind what we perceive as laziness but there isn't a single person on earth who genuinely wants to fail or not do the things they have to or were told to do. The idea behind laziness is that someone who is lazy is choosing not to do something purposefully and without reason other than it's part of their personality but like you've said, it's depression, anxiety, executive dysfunction, or something else. When there is a reason behind it then it isn't laziness and there is ALWAYS reason behind it, whether anyone is aware of the reason or not.",
        "4890": "I grew up believing that I was lazy and feeling bad about it. Now that I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety I can recognise that it\u2019s just my body telling me I need a break. I sometimes still need to remind myself of this but find it helpful to say to myself that I am choosing to rest or choosing to take a shortcut (e.g. ordering food delivery instead of cooking) so I can recover my strength.",
        "4891": "I agree to some extent but when you look at most other animals they spend so much time sitting around doing nothing, they aren\u2019t being lazy though they\u2019re just conserving energy for when they need it.",
        "4892": "I\u2019m glad you have come to this conclusion because yes, you are right. Laziness is just a word to put other people down and make them feel like shit for not being productive every waking second of the day.",
        "4893": "I've always been called lazy but people don't understand that I really struggle to do things that I don't wanna do/ find interesting. I have not been diagnosed with ADD but I've always wondered if I have it. I just really relate to this post.\n\nI score very low for conscientiousness on personality tests so there's that as well. Some studies show that people with trauma, mental illness, or adverse childhood, are more likely to develop these 'undesirable' traits (low conscientiousness etc), so that's important to keep in mind, and that aligns with your line of thinking.",
        "4894": "So my counter to this is that there absolutely is. I am gonna make dinner right now. I could do something that takes 2-ish hours and needs me doing a few prep things or I could do what I intend to do which is make noodles. This is based entirely in laziness. It's not about time efficency because if I could I would order home delivery pizza or something which would take like 1 hour and also cost money. I just wanna put in as little effort as possible for any result. This is laziness. To be motivated exclusively by mimimal effort even when the desired result would be different is the core of laziness. \n\nI think the better question is whether or not it is inherently bad and the answer to that is of course, no it's not. It's a morally ambiguous trait that can lead to bad results. Bad being harmful in this context. It can lead to neutral results and even good results.",
        "4895": "I mean, when I was younger I would be really lazy and procrastinate stuff I didn't want to do, like homework or practicing piano. I wouldn't say I was depressed though. Just a kid who'd rather game than do boring work.",

But sometimes I end up just laying around all day because I don\u2019t have energy. And that\u2019s something no one understands. Sometimes I physically feel like I cannot get up. I wake up at 11 am which is late because I just don\u2019t have the energy. I\u2019m going to a doctor to see if it\u2019s physical but I\u2019m positive it\u2019s mental.",

She helped me realize that the main reason I put off important meetings and phone calls if because of my extreme social anxiety and not just me \u201cbeing lazy\u201d.

It was only when I started really taking therapy seriously that my therapist advised me to take some time after our sessions to truly relax and be kind to myself (watch a nice tv show, have a nice lunch etc). I was a very burnt out college student dealing with heaps of past trauma I hadn\u2019t even gotten through yet as well as all sorts of family drama. Of course I was anxious and depressed! Of course I wasn\u2019t ever going to feel great when I wouldn\u2019t let myself have a break from that! So, I took her advice and relaxed more and now I\u2019m actually proud to be what some would consider \u201clazy\u201d. I need this time for me and that\u2019s really no one else\u2019s business",

The more I learned, the more I realized there's so many variables out there determining human behaviour. \n\nWe don't have free will (IMO) - ALL of our actions have an influence behind them, whether we believe we consciously made a decision or not, there are things out of our control that persuaded said decision. \n\nCommon sense isn't real - every single human being has a different experience in life. Yeah the grass is green but a large part of the population are colour blind, or blind, so to THEM it's not the same green everyone else sees. It's still green, but the brain is processing it differently. \n\nNot everyone has the same motivations, capabilities. Some people are motivated by money, some people aren't. Someone in the r/canadahousing subreddit discussing high rent for student housing, literally said to me \"well, I managed to work 3 jobs while going to school!!\" yeah? i took 6 years to finish high school because i was self harming, couldn't get out of bed, didn't see a future. working 2 jobs at a time almost broke me.",

I dont wanna struggle just to survive long enough to struggle more.\n\nSo yeah, I am lazy but my choices are essentially being lazy or just ending myself to get off this ride.",

        "4920": "So, there might also be a different reasoning. For this, I first need to connect laziness to responsible behavior. Lets say that someone is lazy is when one perceives his or her own responsibilities towards the other but handles those responsibilities only in a flawed manner such so that the the he or she perceives that he or she has dealt responsibly, but the other person does not perceive that he or she has dealt responsibly WHICH he or she could have known if he or she listened to the other person.\n\nWhen you define laziness like this, it becomes harder to weaponize laziness as a means to attack or gaslight people. Why? Let's look at the Boomer example. When Boomers call someone lazy, they don't realize that they have more responsibilities towards the younger generations than the younger generations have to them. Boomers had more chances, more means, but also more errors made for which they have to make up. Contrary, Boomers also had moments of responsibility in which they dealt fully responsibly. These generational differences can lead Boomers to think that they have played there part well enough and that they can relax now. This cause Boomers to let partly go of their responsibilities and only act to such an extent on them to satisfy with the moral satisfaction that comes with the perception you have dealt responsibly. But this differences between having dealt truly responsibly and partially reasonably while thinking you have dealt truly responsibly is lazy if Boomers heard the outcry of younger generations but didn't act on it.\n\nI am inclined to maintain the word laziness due to its moral meaning and to use it to call out people who think they have it 'done correctly' when they haven't and could have known. But there might be a better word than laziness to cover this concept",
        "4921": "Lazy has a negative connotation (dictionary definition: unwilling to work or use energy) as well as passing judgment over someone\u2019s actions.

Didn\u2019t work 80 hours? Lazy! Didn\u2019t get five jobs to make it in life? Lazy! \n\nSo yea you\u2019re onto something. It\u2019s silly.",

I can\u2019t speak on that man\u2019s life. But let\u2019s define laziness as people neglecting their personal responsibilities and being worse off for it. Healthy people don\u2019t watch their lives crumble and do nothing about it. Like if someone isn\u2019t grooming themselves, not doing their homework and sit around all day, doing the bare minimum to live, that\u2019s indicative of some underlying problem. People don\u2019t just watch their lives fall to shit for nothing",

My partner paid for everything (thankfully his job paid enough to do this, but it was VERY tight), and family helped with getting housework done and looking after my kids when I couldn't. But even then it wasn't enough. There were weeks where no washing would be done, bed sheets hadn't been changed for months, dirty dishes piled high for a week. It was truly awful.",

I was able to kill my anxiety pretty well on Wellbutrin, and depression with ketamine therapy. Now that I\u2019m focusing almost entirely on adhd, it\u2019s much easier to address - even COACHING has shown some promise (though it\u2019s a bit like therapy, you have to have a RIGHT coach for you, and I have had no luck there).",

I still procrastinated but also held my schoolwork to greater importance. (Though I guess it could be as simple as taking High School more seriously than Middle School).\n\nBut lately I got more lazy and started just doing the bare minimum for the most part. And I think it could be due to mental health issues. While I don't think I have depression, I'm definitely very nihilistic which makes it hard to feel motivation for things like that.",

Also, no one I knew wanted to \"drop out\", we wanted to have long holidays but that was maybe until 15 when people chose their own school and realosed the consequences of lack of education.

But if you\u2019re a grown adult like \u201cYou say I\u2019m lazy, I think it\u2019s just undiagnosed ADHD\u201d. Okay.

And stop putting words in my mouth just to make me look bad, I don't know you, I'm not calling you garbage. But you don't get to ignore abusive behaviors and turn abusers into victims just because you are anxious or depressed.\n\nI struggle with both, my therapist thinks I'm on the spectrum and I would never inconvenience people just because I don't feel like doing something and either expect others to do it for me or not have it done at all.

This had nothing to do with time efficency because I'd have ordered take out delivery if I had been able to afford it as the time, I wasn't low energy or tired and I would have prefered chicken with rice over noodles so it wasn't my tastes in that moment. It also wasn't hunger, due to several factors I don't feel hunger the same way most people do and not nearly as often, I won't go into why cause that's kinda personal. I'm just covering bases. What is the reason I did this? What kind of behaviour did I partake in?\n\nDo mind that laziness is morally ambiguous and that languge is descriptive not prescriptive.

Here it goes:\n\nIn my opinion and experience, humans automatically always do what gains the most pleasure (either short term or long term) and what gives the least suffers (short term or long term) \n\nThat's all.\n\nTo say it's lazy, is to disrespect someone's needs. Cause at a certain time in history, you were what you did, and this abusive view on people is what created the word lazy. And I don't support that.",
        "5027": "What made it unbearable was those people (except for my husband) trying to blame me for my illness and repeatedly telling me that I wasn't \"good enough.\" That phrase damaged me so much - I'm only just healing from it now, but I had to cut them out of my life inorder to start the healing process.",
        "5028": "You are completely ignoring my points and experience because they don't favour your conclusions. Maybe your research was affected by cognitive bias as well as you accepting only people who agree with you.",
        "5029": "So you have then failed to aduquately justify the removal of the word and not only that, you hold to words having essential meaning.\n\nSee, I didn't describe an act that would provide me with the most pleasure for the least suffers. I don't consider the act of putting in effort into something as inherently bad. Perhaps this is the isssue, you hold to inherent meaning to words beyond the social utility of them where I do not. The way we use language today is queer compared to 200 years ago. Queer as in weird or strange, which was the meaning of the word queer about 200 years ago. Just to illustrate that words do not hold inherent meaning.\n\nEdit: To clarify, I enjoy cooking. I took the route that would take the LEAST effort for inferior pleasure. I am acting in oposition to the idea that you present. Further, if we look at the social utility of the word lazy, there is no innate negativity to the word. Words are not prescriptive they are descriptive and they describe what we decide them to do. We can move away from the idea of lazy being inherently bad without having to remove the word itself because the social utiliy of a word that holds the meaning: \"I did the thing that would reqiure the least amount of effort to get any result I could get even though it may be lacking compared to what an optimal end result would be\". We can just keep the word lazy and shift away from ascribing some inherent negativity to laziness. Just let laziness in itself be morally ambiguous and let the quantifiable harm done by said laziness be the factor which dictates the morality of it.",

I'm saying that there are lazy people and this idea of \"they probably have something\" is simply excusing toxic behaviors, not solving them. They're adults, they're able to seek help or communicate when they're tired but abusive behaviors shouldn't be victomised or excused with this. This idea is not only wrong but only gives defense to people who just don't want to do more than bare minimum to keep doing nothing.",

Ignoring responsibilities by taking an excessive amount of \"breaks\" (i.e. choosing to sit on the couch and watch Netflix when there are dirty dishes in the sink) is bad and strengthens depression. They're *still choices* that you make and depression does not make it impossible for you to tend to your well-being and responsibilities. It makes it harder, but it does not make it impossible.

        "5134": "Im not usually one to leave myself vulnerable by exposing my innter turnoil. But ig its time for me to tell someone. Im early 20s, and ive had a fairly shit life. I was abused for as long as i can remember,  both mentally and physically. Both to extremes that have caused me to develop ptsd at a rather young age. My mother sheltered me, which caused me to develop attachment issues. With two opposite extremes tearing me into different directions, i have always been conflicted about how to properly understand my emotions, breaking my psyche in two, metaphorically. I basically have to argue with myself to come to any sort of conclusion. My dad was in jail 75% of my life. And when he was out, he was cheating on my mother very blatantly, and terrorizing my family. And then my mother was diagnosed with cancer. She made it roughly 3 years, before she had to get an operation on her intertines, which was done very poorly. It ended up breaking the stitches, which caused it to get infected. After that, she couldnt be saved. So i was forced to make a choice. Allow her to suffer until the end, or sign the papers Nd let her go peacefully. Ive never forgiven myself for signing that paper. I hold myself entirely responsible for my mothers death. And i also found out around that time i also have bpd. Ive been fighting my toxic side forever, trying to unlearn everything i was raised on, but those toxic traits have saved me on many occasions,  so i find it hard to figure out what about me is good, and what is not. I am a human paradox, constantly going against myself. Im miserable, i disgust myself physically, i havent had a real relationship my entire life, my emotions are like geysers waiting to explode from the pressure bottled up, im suicidal as hell,  only managing to fight it back so i dont leave all of my pain on ny siblings. I cant do much without becoming frustrated and sometimes belligerent. The only emotion i can properly process is anger. All the time. Nothing but anger. I desperately want to love and be loved, but ive never been in a position to deserve either. I cant do anything right. Im a waste of space and time. I havent functionally done anything with my life. I dont drive, no family of my own. Im basically just floating around in a world i never belonged in. So im just trying to push my siblings to a point where my selfishness wont break their spirit. I want them to get all they deserve and more, so i can take on my karmah silently and never have to face them with my shame again. Sorry to whoever reads this. Ik its long and kinda convoluted. But im basically just a broken man. With an even more broken heart. And nothing to show that ive been alive. An invisible monster, only there to show you what not to become. An illustration of failure at its most concentrated",

She sneaked out of her house ( which is around 40 kms away from here) to meet me on my birthday in October, noone had ever done anything so good for me tbh. It was all very intoxicating for a few months when some red flags started to show, I gave her  space,  good communication, even put efforts during my end term exams to make sure things go well, and they did, we went on a couple more dates, both of them were some of the better times I've shared with another person, after the second date, she dumps me ,on text, suddenly saying she doesn't see a future.\n\nI just said okay, lmk if you change your mind and block her from my life to help myself get over easily, i was jobless, obese, and apparently lonely too now.\n\n4 months later, I got myself an above average job I could never think I would, lost around 10 kgs, 10 more to go to reach my best physique, went through a phase where my family was in severe atrocity due to covid.\n\nIn these 4 months she did send a few texts, sober and drunk, I replied politely and didn't respond if I didn't want to. A few days ago she asked to fix things but when I said no she told me she just wants to give me a chance to tell her how I felt and talk to her. I was appalled, she just was not the nice self aware and compassionate girl she used to be, now she sounds like an immature and entitled child.\n\nI still think about her, even though everything else in my life is turning for the better and I have not let this incident affect my life in any way ( did go on a tinder date, enjoyed myself but not willing to invest my time in dating rn) , but it sure affected me. I think about her over lonely cigarettes, sleepless nights, and from someone so uptight like me this poetic expression is debilitating, but that is  just how I feel.\n\nI have few friends but I think I'm too embarrassed to toot this horn of sadness again and again lol, and with the job, life is really stressed and I think I am lonely enough to express myself on reddit so yeah.",

If your job was toxic and bad for you it's good that you quit as soon as you can, happiness is the most important thing. I'm sure that no matter what you do just trying to do something for you sister will make her happy so defintley try to do something big but don't worry about it too much she'll appreciate whatever you do. I've had adhd since I was barely old enough to talk, I was in therapy for a bit before I even knew what therapy was, I was given pills for it before I was even 7 and even though they helped with my attention span and energy they made me who I wasn't so I learned to accept that I have adhd and honestly I kinda enjoy it now even though sometimes it really does suck.",

I can't keep a job because I get bored of it in less than a week, I never got paid for a full week cause I never lasted that long. In general I just have no feelings towards anyone and it annoys me to pretend to care about people like I've tried soant times to make friends like online but I just get bored of talking to them and just block them after like 2 weeks.

In a desperate attempt to find a scalable salve, I put in a grant to help me fund a website to promote the positive mental health benefits of certain video games. I desperately hope it gets approved.

        "5436": "Mine has def improved. I\u2019m a 30 year old female union factory worker. My job is extremely physical and strenuous, but i NEED it for the money and mostly the health insurance. For 11 years from age 18-29 i didnt have health coverage. I saw a few different therapists through referrals from the free clinic i went to, but it didnt really help. Over that decade i was in college for 2.5 years and ended up just not going back one day and leaving bc everything in my life was too much. I live in a very toxic household and started working at age 14, and tried college so i could not end up like my parents... and in that time i tried at least 5 different SSRIs (anti depressants) but they didnt really ever work.\n\nDuring the year prior to me starting my job at Ford (and having health coverage) I was In a very bad place. A new SSRI seemed like it was helping a little bit possibly, but it caused me to do stuff in my sleep and it was scary. I tried a new one and it made me worse, which is something i had felt the SSRIs had always done, thats why i never took them for long. At about age 22 i started to realize more and more that i knew what was wrong with me mentally, but i didnt have the health coverage to actually find out. \n\nAge 29 my insurance was finally in full swing and i made an appointment with a psychiatrist and was finally properly diagnosed. She said that I have bipolar disorder (what i figured it was for years) and that anti depressants actually make you WAY worse and cause you to \u201crapid cycle\u201d...she is still my psychiatrist and i have also been seeing a therapist. Even though I\u2019m really unhappy at my job i need it for the excellent pay, and free, amazing, health insurance. It\u2019s saved my life.\n\nOn the 13th of March I worked my last shift due to COVID-19. that week i only worked 2 out my 4 shifts bc i was in a bad place mentally that week and i used my two days that i am allowed to use if i need a mental health day. I get two days a month that i can use to stay home if needed through my FMLA (family medical leave act) paperwork. So my check that week was only fir 2 days. Luckily the week before i got my yearly profit sharing check so i had a decent amount of cash at the time...so for the first 3 weeks of not working i had no money worries even though i didnt have any coming in. \n\nDuring the first 3 weeks of being laid off i have been in such a great place mentally. I have been painting, crafting, cleaning, organizing, reading, started a new skin care routine, writing, sleeping well and napping sometimes, cooking for myself and the family ( due to my work hours i can\u2019t due this generally)... i have been in a really great place mentally, and i know it\u2019s bc i have not had to work. However, due to all this i had to blow that money and I\u2019m getting really scared that i will not be able to move into my friends apartment in June when their roommate leaves as planned. Which is something that i REALLY need in order to prosper. Two days after valentines day last year my boyfriend of 3 years that i lived with woke up one morning and dumped me and kicked me out of our apt...three days after being added to my phone contract and getting new phones... and a week after i got in a terrible car accident totaling my 3 month old car and breaking my sternum...he was an asshole i guess, and i had to move back home, and buy a bed and a car... so this past year i have been rebuilding my life. \n\nSo yes, for the first 3 weeks i was in an amazing place mentally, bc i didnt have the stress of my job. Ive already been aware that i feel i only have 5-10 good years of working full time in me. My job is so exhausting and since I\u2019m on an assembly line it\u2019s all mindless, physical work that leave me trapped in my head for 12 hours straight. Plus the hour commute back and forth, i can\u2019t do anything but work, eat, sleep during my work week. I know I\u2019m only 30, but ive been working since i was 13, and have always worked very hard trying to get away from my toxic life. I have already feared that i mentally won\u2019t be able to handle full time for that much longer, and this real segmented that I\u2019m right. That work is too stressful at times for my mental health to be able to get up on time, get myself out of bed, get there on time and do the work. I can go a month without needing a break but if i have a bipolar episode i don\u2019t know when it comes, what to expect, or how long it will stay. I mean, i can be a feminist and know that at the end of the day i need extra care, and if i get married I\u2019m gonna need someone that understands that, and i can hopefully go to working part time only, and somewhere much easier, and that i may actually enjoy. \n\nSo now that my money is gone, and my unemployment still has yet to start coming in, i am starting to get really anxious. Also, i live bear chicago and northwest indiana, so the weather is really changing. When the weather starts getting nice, and i can smell it in the air, and it\u2019s sunny out, i get really really anxious. I don\u2019t know what it is, like reverse seasonal affective or perhaps my body remembering trauma. My first, clear, bipolar depressive phase started at age 22, at this time when the weather was changing for spring. It lasted til October and for the first time i understood how people could end their life. I was no stranger to depression, but this was different. For some reason i knew i would never be the same. Now, bc of that long bipolar episode i get super anxious at even the smell of nice weather. Not always, but it can be bad when it does.\n\nSo, i was in a really good place during this for weeks. The happiest i had been in a VERY VERY long time. But I\u2019m super anxious now....however, i think if my unemployment was coming in i would still be in a great place... i really do hope that you feel better. If you need to talk you can send me a PM, all i have is time... just know that you are not alone. We are a community.",
        "5437": "Yea",
        "5438": "Mine's always been horrible\n\nIt's still horrible\n\nAm I gonna go into cardiac arrest any minute? Probably.",
        "5439": "I feel like my depression has gotten a little better since I am getting to spend more time with my daughter, but on the flip side of that, spending more time with my daughter has my anxiety at full tilt.",
        "5440": "Yeah man.  Idk if it just feels easier for some (and is actually jeopardising their recovery) or if it actually benefits some, but my mental health is taking a hit.\n\nUni moved online, now can't keep up with material and assessments, nor can I work sitting in the same place all day in my room, so I just dropped all the subjects (real shame because this was the first in like 4 semesters I was actually making progress and looking to sit some exams), the gym closed so all those goals are kinda fucked - fitness also because I can't really run too regularly because of my feet - and the mental health benefits of doing shit has gone, I don't get outside enough and in general am just flattening quite a bit.\n\nThing is it's not wasted time.  In times where you can't do things, improve, expose yourself to new experiences, maintain some of your hobbies, exercise fully or even work, you can always practice mindfulness - in fact this is the best time to do so.\n\nIt's important just to keep a few good habits going:\n\nBrushing your teeth/ washing daily\n\nEating regularly and focus on nutrition (try to get enough healthy fats, proteins, vitamins, fibre, antioxidants in your day and avoid processed sugars and saturated fats - especially as being in quarantine, these sugars and sat fats just weaken your tolerance to life).  Maybe you can even hit a caloric defecit and lose some fat if you want, although not recommended for weight trainers who want to maintain muscle mass.\n\nExercising - go for a run, do some pushups every 2nd hour, some Turkish getups maybe, single leg squats etc. This really revolutionizes your mindset for days even after one thing (one set of pushups at max reps at the start of the day can make the difference between a good day and a shit one).\n\nOutside - go for a walk or sit in the sun for any amount of time.  This does a similar thing as exercising.\n\nAny discipline - people don't like doing nothing.  We like to think we like doing nothing so that we trick ourselves into being motivated to do things with the promise of respite afterwards, but we only like recovering from hard work, not doing nothing.  For this reason, it is much more beneficial to read stimulating material, learn things in depth or generally improve at things - vegetating on the couch watching netflix or gaming (not all gaming ofc) will just lower your resilience and generally decrease your sense of purpose.\n\nInstead, try to find something you want to do, or have been meaning to do but been putting off, and focus all other energy on that.  Of course if you have just about any solid responsibility in this time, most of your resources will probably will be preoccupied with dealing with that.  If you have few commitments though, finding something productive is a great way to make use of your time.\n\nFor me, I've been meaning to read Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Solzhenitsyn for a while - maybe I'll read war and piece.  I've been reading Aurelius, and have been wanting to read up on Epictetus.  Similarly I've been practicing my trumpet improv which needs a lot of work, and bettering my poker game.  I still have a few things to do with uni (study some prerequesites but also just general academic interests) so I've been doing that too.\n\nThese probably won't apply to you, but the point is if I do all of these (in order), it becomes a lot harder to have a bad day.  If I have a bad day, it's normally because I have failed to do one of the things, and really that is just a lack of discipline.",
        "5441": "Mine has gotten significantly better!! Because I no longer have to go to work every day and fake a smile 24/7, drain myself verbally and mentally keeping small talk with older clients and coworkers, physically try to walk around like I don\u2019t have a weight on my shoulders nobody can see(my mom is a high functioning suicidal alcoholic with a xanax prescription she abuses, and verbally abuses me though I literally do every thing for her including cooking all of her meals and cleaning her room/the apartment, and is currently living with my bf and I as my dad recently split from her and he no longer is there to keep an eye on her/monitor her drinking and suicidal ideation, and my older brother no longer cares). Simply not having to act like I am happy when I am severely depressed with generalized anxiety(and on medication + doing biofeedback on myself at work), and also deal with work stressors, has been life changing. \n\nI love my job, and at my lowest points it was/is the thing that keeps me going. But the rude parents and lower end spectrum clients I work with can be so hard to work with(keeping that fake smile) 5 days a week with such difficult personal life problems. I was also working overtime on top of this for the last three months(mom moved in 4 months ago), so I don\u2019t get home till about 7:30-8 most nights when I\u2019m at work by 9-9:30 am. Eating dinner that late after I cook it, and it sometimes being my only real meal of the day was just another thing bringing me down. Now I have time to make food and actually enjoy eating it!\n\nThings are hard at home sometimes, but if I isolate myself in my room and avoid my mom at all costs/bite my tongue, things are pretty damn good. I\u2019ve been quarantined along with all of them(we all got over the virus!) for over four weeks and I couldn\u2019t be happier.",

Just making a single noise would lead to everyone screaming at you. And I end up having to take my anger out on literally anything because of being so constantly exhausted. Like my bro just asks where the milk is and I end up being pissed at him for no reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then again, I now have time to write and draw, and that's a good output for all my pent up emotions that I'm not allowed to talk about or show.

Even though I'm an extrovert, the idea of staying at home for a bit seemed like a vacation, but without the annoying bits of going through an airport or finding someone to watch the dogs.\n\nMy partner wasn't affected by the transition to work from home, so they're still working a regular 9-5 schedule. So worrying about how we're going to pay the mortgage or buy groceries is thankfully not something that I worry about. \n\nAt the start I was crazy productive doing things around that house that I have been meaning to do for ages, started a garden, sanded and restained the outdoor furniture, cleaned the garage... so many things. That was Mid-March?\n\nNow, I'm still forcing myself to do things. Cook dinner, clean the house, make the bed, laundry, mow the yard/misc. yard work, all necessary errands (grocery shopping, picking up dog's medications, etc.) but I'm crying at the drop of a hat. I feel so overwhelmed and drowning, but I don't know what I'm drowning in, if that makes sense.\n\nSo, to be honest, I'm not sure how I'm doing. I thought I was doing okay, but now I don't know. I come from a long history of depression and the past few years, after I quit a terrible career and transitioned into a 180\\* opposite career, have been the most stable, happy, and optimistic I've been since I was 14?

I have a job, but my productivity and motivation have plummeted significantly.  \n\nI\u2019m a single guy, living a lone, not able to visit my parents across town because I would hate for them to become ill if I am carrying the virus.  Not being in a relationship, and the prospect of not finding a partner in a bar or coffee shop has this feeling like a really lonely time right now.  \n\nWhen the gym opens, I\u2019ll be able to workout all of my frustrations, but for now, I am struggling.",

For all the doom and gloom out there, the more fact filled, straight laced stories fall the way side.\n\nWhile the state I currently live in, NM, seems to be handling the whole thing better than some, I've been appalled by the lack of care from most that live here in this stateline community. Being right next to TX, there exists that more militant \"my rights\" type of mindset that some just have to be proudly vocal of. Of course I've been dealing with that on some level since moving out here eight years ago. So again, really thinking the next best thing once this all settles down a bit is to run with my move into a further remote area.\n\nOf course apart from a small subsistence garden, I'll probably have to look into some other profession that doesn't require leaving the future homestead much. Kind of a hard thing in and of itself to do when I barely graduated high school 19 years ago and have only recently managed to get my footing in a troubling subject like college algebra.\n\nOn the upside of things, I wouldn't call myself defeatist in taking this further isolating route. Never have been in a relationship and don't have kids of my own. So perhaps all those years of staying on the outside of that drama has somewhat prepped me.",

It just gets to be to much that I completely shut down. I just distract myself and sticking to a schedule helps, routine is normal for me. I have to have a routine or I'll shut down.

In no way shape or form is this your fault.\n\nIMO, there is no excuse for parents to behave this way regardless of political affiliation. Treat her as you would if a coworker, friend, cousin, stranger talked to you this way (ONLY in the sense that there is NO excuse for their behavior and you would cut off communication with those people, and her being your mother doesn\u2019t grant her any level of automatic forgiveness). \n\nIf you used to have a good relationship with your mom or community that turned sour, I\u2019ve done some light research on the whole \u201cChristianity in politics\u201d thing that may help if you feel confused. Because I too have been dumbfounded by the last 4 years, increasingly so each day, losing faith in humanity both from a spiritual aspect as well as a government aspect. **I know that this won\u2019t fix anything and in NO WAY does it excuse your mother\u2019s, or ANY other Trump supporter\u2019s behavior. I only wish to help ease the part of your mind that is confused on the WHY, so you can let go of the grief and confusion and live your life as you please, whatever that may look like.**\n\n* Now in the 80s, the first religious political organization \u201c[Moral Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Majority)\u201d gained traction and was so successful in the Reagan campaign, many say it\u2019s the origin of the mainstream belief that \u201crepublicans = Christian\u201d. This is also the beginning of political and religious organizations using each others followings for leverage.\n\n* Christians actually tend to vote more democrat as a WHOLE demographic, across mainline sects, whereas Evangelical voters, who is the group we hear a lot about in politics today, tend to lean republican ([2016 Religious Groups and Polical Leanings](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/23/u-s-religious-groups-and-their-political-leanings/) (take a look, I think you\u2019ll be surprised by catholic!). Keep in mind this study was done in 2014 - so pre-Trumpism.\n\n* Trump\u2019s appeal to \u2018Christian\u2019 (but actually Evangelical) voter squad is more to do with cultural alignment of what they think is \u201ca real man\u201d. I know... it sounds too ridiculous to be true. [This](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-white-evangelicals-love-a-mean-tough-son-of-a-gun-like-donald-trump-11598540777) article on MarketWatch (sub of WSJ) explains how the Evangelical ideals of a man was a \u2018pull up from your bootstraps, tough son of a bitch\u2019 kinda guy. Sound familiar? It\u2019s almost too ridiculous for me to type, but it explains how DESPITE Trump\u2019s totally obvious hypocrisy on all religious values, these ppl still vote/worship him because to them, that\u2019s what a \u2018MAN\u2019, therefore a \u2018LEADER\u2019, therefore an \u2018AMERICAN\u2019 looks like (I could go on but I think the ties to racism, homophobia, capitalism, and The American South are pretty clear from there on out). I\u2019m sure this is not the only explanation or origin - it is also the same with Reagan, that he was the \u2018pull up your bootstraps, American dream, business owner, \u2018not a politician\u2019\u2019 guy.\n\n* Basically, it\u2019s primarily that the rich, old guys that have run these political and religious orgs/groups have COMPLETELY manipulated the people that follow them for their sole personal gain, and it\u2019s been going on for about 40 years. Literally a dozen or so vanilla white dudes have run these \u2018organizations\u2019, first appealing to their follower\u2019s existing beliefs and gathering a faithful fan base, and manipulating the people by indoctrinating beliefs that maximize their own personal gain in one way or another (like... basically how pyramid schemes and cults work). They\u2019re so good at it too, that basically no matter what evidence or facts are presented, these leaders have \u2018blind faith\u2019 from their supporters that they are explicitly exploiting. \n\n* In the Obama era\u2019s progressive legislation, for reasons that are probably obvious, these leaders were pissed that their \u2018advantage\u2019 had been taken away because they were no longer able to exploit the system they\u2019d set up for themselves (taxes, along other things).  So. Doing what they do. They tell their followers that basically anything progressive = punitive for their \u2018group\u2019. They truly convinced their followers that they were being oppressed by the Left, that \u2018equality for everyone\u2019 really meant \u2018unfairness for US\u2019 & that the Left was trying to \u2018exploit\u2019 them through the legal system by taking OUT religion (ahem... clearly hypocritical).\n\nThat all being said. The only reason I know all this isn\u2019t to make excuses. It\u2019s literally because I could not fathom how 2016 happened and how people could seriously be so narcissistic/uneducated/blind. I cut out Trump supporters from my life and from taking up room in my head once I came to the realization that there was no level of evidence, facts, proof, or logic that would explain what happened (and one of Trumpism\u2019s most horrible crimes is the demonization of evidentiary support  - \u2018if it\u2019s not saying what I want it to say, then it must be fake\u2019). \n\nRegardless of your decisions on relationship with mom and your personal beliefs, I hope this helped at least lend some clarity that your beliefs are valid, you are not alone, and some insight on \u2018how could this happen\u2019. I\u2019m not even implying that your mom is a victim in this situation, there\u2019s reason that many people are \u2018turned off\u2019 by religion as a whole right now because of these extremists (including people that probably used to go to church with them). The people that were left standing, blindly believing... well, consider them like the group of teenagers that goes out murdering because Charles Manson tells them to (wish that were more figurative than it actually is).\n\nWishing you the best.",

You don't really know what you're talking about so please try to do some research or have more empathy for people before posting stuff like this.\n\nMost people, when they first realize they're not \"normal\" band together with other folks like them. That can be gays, trans people, or straight dudes that like musical theater. Outcasts band together.\n\nBeing trans specifically, there are some specific milestones that most binary trans people go through, like starting therapy, getting on HRT, getting surgery, etc. Most people I know, once they're past the initial stages of transitioning, go \"stealth.\" This means that they're not openly trans anymore because they can \"pass\" as a cis person in their preferred gender. I guarantee you've probably worked with a couple people in this stage of their life.\n\nPersonally, I'm 27 and have been transitioning since 21. I'm pretty well past the point where I hang out with only other trans people, and have been \"stealth\" in my professional life for more than five years at this point. I stated that I'm trans on this post because it is a cultural shorthand for liberal politics.\n\nBeing trans or participating in \"trans culture\" is not comparable to supporting an authoritarian political candidate over your own child.",

I can't change what I have lost, and I accept that. That does not mean that I can't look forward to the future and enjoy what that has to offer. In terms of friendships, relationships, my own development, future jobs and hobbies etc. \n\nNow that I'm well-ish, I find myself dwelling very little on what I have lost.

He published this discovery and was basically laughed out of town and completely discredited by his peers because these women couldn\u2019t possibly be abused if they had come from upper class, well respected families.  Freud was forced to change his theory to what it is today... That the women he studied were having sexual fantasies about their father figures which caused their hysteria. \n\nThink about how much further along we\u2019d be if we based all the research we\u2019ve done since then on his original theory instead of his alternative theory? \n\nI could go on for hours about this, but if you want to know more (and have it explained better), Judith Herman goes into it in detail (with sources) in the first chapter of her book \u201cTrauma and Recovery.\u201d ",

Finding a therapist, even in a government institution, eventually comes down to luck: Will you get a therapist who cares and is properly educated, or will you get some idiot that quotes \"The Secret\"?

Everything must be tested and replicated repeatedly to ensure there is no error, before it is established as reliable and new research can be built on top of it.\n\nYou can actually see it when paradigm shifts ocur. The paradigm shift is actually made, usually in a relatively small institution, very quickly, but is not even shared to others until several tests mark it as viable. Once shared all new institutions have to replicate whatever experiments have been done to corroborate to accept this shift, which is why the shift takes very long to spread. If you look into it, you'll see many radical shits were actually made in the 80's, and we just now getting to hear them, for this reason.\n\nArrogance would be what the alternative \"medicine\" practicioners do: insist they've got it right, everyone else had it wrong, and go with it demanding acceptance even in the absences of throough evidence. Alternative \"medicine\" advances pretty quickly in contrast to regular medicine for this reason: see how long it took us to get from \"Maybe the body affects the mind too\" to \"Cancer is caused by your thoughts and through my 'psychotherapy' I can cure cancer\" (BioNeuroEmoci\u00f3n or Bioneuroemotion or whatever), or how fast we went from \"Family relations reliably affect the mental health of the individuals of the family\" (Systemic family therapy, which is legit) to \"You are conected to your ancestors and your depression is caused by the spiritually transmited trauma your great-great grandmother had a hundred years ago\" (Hellinger's nonesence) precicely because while the institute of Millan was thorough in its testing and humble to say \"We think, but we're not sure it is true yet\" and took its time, Bert Hellinger just declared his method was a breakthrough and started giving seminars everywhere.\n\nFreud is another example. He didn't really test his ideas. He falsified evidence and ignored evidence that his theories didn't work, or outright hid it to preserve his image. His ideas were impresive (even if not accurate) and he right away went to declare it truth and go on teaching. Sadly psychoanalists everwhere today still hang on to those nonesensical ideas and just won't let go, despite both evidence that Freud was wrong and theories about the mind that explain it way better than Freud's ever did. But there's nothing more arrogant than a psychoanalist, so don't expect them to let go soon.\n\nScience moves at the speed of stone, but its results are solid.",

I call it the art of disconnection as it can be a great useful skill if utilised.  \n\n\nAn easy example for me is my ability to let go of my emotional attachments and personal feelings during work.

        "6320": "You\u2019re in a really advantageous position. You know how to trigger they self-shaming conformist side of your mind. You even basically allude to seeing it as a separate thing. \n\nConsider what\u2019s going on in your brain. Your neurons fire for a concept - and these neural firings for the things you like for no reason are who you are - but then another part of your brain comes in and shames it for even firing to begin with. This is another part of your brain that is telling that source of inspiration that it shouldn\u2019t be this way, that is, you shouldn\u2019t be this way. That there\u2019s something with how your brain works and that it should work a different way. But that\u2019s impossible because the things your neurons fire for have no rhyme or reason.  You are who you are, and this is who you are fundamentally. You alter this fundamental self. \n\nThe reason you are in an advantageous position is because knowing how to ambush this negativity allows you to alter it. At some point in your life you were shamed by another for sharing something, but now that person is long gone. What they left in you in that moment is machinery that does their work for them. So now instead of them shaming you, it is another part of you shaming you. But you can capture it, alter it and turn it into an ally. You see, we are born without boundaries. We need others to help us form those boundaries.  Children drown in pools because their neurons fire for the big blue puddle, but they don\u2019t have any concept of being safe. Safety is a boundary that stopes neuronal firing from killing you. We need boundaries, but boundaries can be malformed. Mom says \u201cdon\u2019t go near the pool!\u201d which he again and attack on the fundamental self. She saying your neurons shouldn\u2019t fire for pool, that there\u2019s something wrong with you. Instead mom should say \u201cwe can go in the pool but stay in the shallow end until you\u2019re ready for the deep end\u201d which instead tells us that there\u2019s nothing wrong with our brain but that we should act in a safe manner. What you have is a malformed boundary that exists too close to the source of that firing. It\u2019s too quick to extinguish the inspiration! But now they you know how to trigger it, you can capture it in your hands and make it move back a few passes to let the neurons breath. \u201cListen, you will now be my friend and will chime in to make sure that what I\u2019m doing doesn\u2019t harm myself or others. There\u2019s is nothing wrong with me or my neuronal firing so step back over here and help me be safe.\u201d\n\nThis will be uncomfortable at first, you\u2019ll feel they numbness, but if you can create a healthy boundary you will be free to post whatever you want whenever you want, as long as it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone or yourself. That numbness wont come back. I really hoped that that helped. I\u2019m on the 17th day of this journey and I\u2019ve never been happier and more shame free.

Something similar happens in person and I go quiet and then just sit in my head with all my spiraling negative thoughts and it can put me in a depressive, or at least non-responsive, state for anywhere from a few minutes to a whole day.

You must be brave, and not be afraid to place yourself in a vulnerable position.\n\nTo find out what is true for you personally, you must watch your thought and behaviour patterns, from a neutral non-interfering seat of awareness.",
        "6363": "Just as a side note, the theoretical framework that OP is using to advise you would not only include a fear of abandonment for such behaviour but also (or instead, depending) a fear of rejection.  \n \nThe difference between abandonment and rejection can be illustrated in many ways, for example: if you were given up for adoption by a family unable to survive and help you strive, it is abandonment (even when intentions aren't necessarily negative). If you were left by your family that had the ability to care for you, that could be rejection. I used family but it could be individuals or groups of people of any sort.  \nAn additional perspective on this framework is that the words are focused on *how you experienced* things, not on *what exactly happened*. It is about subjective experience, which is hard to untangle when it occurs in life, and even more so if it happens in formative years.   \n\nFinally, it's also worth noting that this is *one* approach to what could be affecting you, not an absolute theory of the world which stands true for everyone at all time.  \n\nHowever, the advice given regarding the observation of your thoughts, behaviours and beliefs, is one anchored in a type of more broadly tested therapeutic tool called CBT (Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy). It's getting a lot of praise in the last couple decades and most of it really isn't undeserved.  \nThere are free resources out there to try to approach that on your own, but there is really some merit to doing it with the help of a therapist. It's hard to go from nothing to being able to slow things down, think \"what am I thinking right now?\", or \"why did I think this just now? what emotion do I feel? what is the source of this emotion?\" etc.  \n\nIn any case, in the behaviour you described, you're not alone and there are ways to find a healthier life balance in the long run :)",

My core belief: I am not safe in any situation. Experience: my friends throw a surprise party for me. Trigger: everyone knew about this but me and I don\u2019t feel settled because I believe that I\u2019m not safe (this belief is what causes my feeling). Feeling: vulnerable, anxious and guilty that I\u2019m not enjoying something that should have been fun. \nThis core belief did not help this situation - if I had believed I was safe (by pushing through my initial core belief and actually accessing the situation at hand for what it was) I would have been excited by the party and I wouldn\u2019t have been triggered",

He was in critical care at the vet for a couple of days for blood tests and evaluation. They said he hadn't peed the entire time. I walked in to see him and immediately he stood up and peed in his box. The tech said she had tried to help him stand up and go the whole day and he just wanted to lay there until he saw me. \n\nI remember when it was time to say goodbye, the vet let me take him home for one last night. He and I slept in the bathroom floor together away from the other cats. I just laid there crying and holding him. Angry that this was happening to him and hating myself for what I had to do the next day even though it was what was best for him. \n\nI remember that he was having trouble walking and he wouldn't eat or drink. I got really upset and just lost it. He got up and walked over to me and nudged me with his head and climbed into my lap. I can still see his little face looking up at me. He was pushing himself to his limit to make sure I was ok. That's the moment I realized he was hanging on for me. And that wasn't fair. \n\nI've always loved my cats and I always will. But Binx was special. He came into my life as a scrawny abandoned stray and when he left, he took a piece of me with him.\n\nI'm saying all of this because you need to know that your kitty did that for a reason.

The dopamine fasting is a bit misguided, because dopamine doesn't have to be related to a luxury. Even the very nature of a Dopamine fast is dopamine based. Some need that dopamine to even 'do that something'. Perhaps akin to how depressed people, even when treated, are zombies, just going through the motions. I have been there. Sometimes it's a good start to get to a better place, but it should not be the plateau. Life can be so much more. We both can.",

        "6668": "First (hug) I do understand this so very very well. I'll be 36 in January and my first cry for help was in third grade yes I promise third grade so I was roughly 8 I think... I have been hospitalized many times, seen loads of psych doctors tried loads of pills. They changed the DSM so I'm not sure what I'm even technically diagnosed anymore it was manic depressive ( just what they called it then)  at 16 BPD and bipolar. I knew it was worse I never felt right.. eventually they shrunk it all down to schizoafective bipolar disorder, which was the short of, Schizophrenia, bipolar ( heavy depression) DiD, BPD, and CPTSD and GAD... At 25. My doctor tried for 10 years to help and then decided I was medicine/treatment resistant, I was on a lot of meds he cold turkey pulled me off them... He recently gave me kolonopin for panic attacks. Other than that I have no more bandaids. I had to basically relearn how to be myself.. everyone always said I was a rainbow even though they had no clue (except my partners) who I really was and what I was going through. After years and years of not understanding myself and thinking oh no you've turned out to be exactly like the people who ruined you..  I decided to try and fix this messed up shit in my head.. I started learning about childhood trauma, and started understanding me better. I was trying to get into a CPTSD therapist but none seem to take my insurance. I bought work books and everything... I'm not saying I magically got better by any means I still fight depression and my schizophrenia. My DID has turned wild during this withdrawl mess, which is so hard for my husband... I went over three months just sitting in my bed starting at my phone being mad... I was even losing my cool with my boop puppy. Idk why but I've been granted with a few great days and I even got my art passion back... It's funny because my vet actually explained my dogs anxiety ( he came from a verrrrry bad situation.) Is like he's constantly trying to go up the hill but he can't reach the top.. idk why but that hit hard... I had dreams, I wanted to be a mom I wanted to do everything right that I didn't get, but I decided that bc of mine and my husband's genetics children probably weren't the best thing for us, not that everyone facing MI should make that choice but it is what's best for us.  So I let that dream die.. growing up I loved cartoons, anime, and video games I wanted in that industry some how, I had to be pulled out of school at 16 bc I was sick. I eventually got a little college,  but just couldn't hack it.  I had to let go of all my once dreams thanks to a shitty childhood and bad genetics... Medication can be a life savior for so many people even though the side effects tend to suck and you have to keep trying until you find the right combo or the doc throws in the towel in my case. I guess I want you to know that even though life may not end up what you once wanted and desperately hoped for happiness is still out there. Even though it took me 35 years to try and unfuck myself lol that's the title of one of my workbooks, I don't think it's ever to late to try and find your happy even if it's not what you expected.. so now my goals in life have changed to just working on my art and trying to be a better me.  \ud83d\udc9c sorry ugh I'm one of those ppl who never shuts up...

The drugs aren\u2019t helping, I guess they never did really, well maybe they did a few times. But not at wasting time, I guess except at work. You know you hear how money isn\u2019t important, I wish they would\u2019ve been a lil more specific about how it isn\u2019t important lol either way I was screwed the mania and hallucinations took away my chance at a fulfilling life and then the depression and anxiety just come back with new power, like now it\u2019s because I\u2019ve wasted over a decade, but as soon as I\u2019d get things on the right track everything would fall apart with another fit of mania. At least now I can collect disability, I\u2019ve just always been happier working I would say, I had it nice working on my one night stand dad\u2019s farm, but he won\u2019t talk to me anymore because of my felonies. Lol fuck him, his drunken sperm is the reason I have mental illness in the first place and then his bitch ass can just bail on the life he brought into this world and I\u2019m stuck suffering thru it. Nothing I can do but get sober and try to find a cash paying job, maybe then I can have some life in me to work and live for something more than getting high and playing video games. Still if it weren\u2019t for the full blown mania I wouldn\u2019t be the way iam, I don\u2019t care what society says much but I do care how it feels to waste away and hate it. The depression and anxiety I break by looking at life thru the eyes of a madman I guess, the hypomania is kinda nice to. It\u2019s just the full blown mania destroys everything and the hallucinations don\u2019t help at all. Hope your traveling turns out, just thought I\u2019d share hopefully it makes you feel a bit better about what feels like a waste, it can\u2019t be as bad as me, I spend 75-90% of my time alone. And the insanity is growing in ways that leave me in fear of a terrible last few years, with catatonic depression marred with tormenting voices. But if I can get sober I may be able to beat it with positive thinking as I rekindle my faith and love for God, people and life as we know it, rather than the way I\u2019ve seen it in my mind.",

All of the gaslighting and the manipulation from people who said they \"care about us\" prior to all of it.\n\nIt really make you think are we the ones with \"mental health issues\" all because we are not ashamed of showing our feeling and following our hearts?  Or are the people who subjected us to abuse and all the other reason.  Maybe they are the ones who actually have the mental health issues.  Because they try to control others and tell us how to behave for example when we are not hurting anyone, yet they want to try and control our lives?\n\nThis is just me thinking out loud so take it with a grain of salt, given I an talking from my own personal experiences.  Be it from family, \"friends\" or where we work and how we get treated.  I just mean from the treatment we endured from these same people.  It makes me wonder how they would be if the tables were turned on them....",

What helps me is thinking that yes, you can't get back the time you lost but you can always start living NOW. Make your life about enjoying yourself and doing all the things you missed out on. Don't care about your age, it doesn't mean anything. You might have missed out on some stuff like teen romance, i know i did, but there's so much more beyond that. Romance will always exist. Be proud of the person you are and the things you achieved inspite all the mental issues you had to go trough. Just exist in the moment, focus on becoming your better self and start geniunely  enjoying life. Let go of expectations. Don't compare yourself to others ( easier said than done, but it CAN be done ). Forget all of the time you've lost, it doesn't exist anymore, it's not real, it doesn't matter. You exist in the present moment, you have your own life and you can do whatever you want. I hope you can be happy, good luck :)",

My dad died when I was 2. He was in a car accident, and I was supposed to be in that car. If it weren\u2019t for my aunt (may she Rest In Peace) I wouldn\u2019t be here today. After that day I lived with her in Illinois, as my mom was an addict at the time and I wasn\u2019t allowed to be with her. When I was 7, my mom \u201cgot clean\u201d and I was sent back to live with her in California. I didn\u2019t want to do it but I had no choice. Eventually, my mom, my grandparents, my other aunt, my uncle, my cousins and I moved up north to Washington. My grandparents and uncle were supposed to build property up there, but it never happened. While we lived there, we had to get used to the cold nights during the winter. On one of these nights, my mom, who was \u201cclean\u201d at the time got upset with me. I can\u2019t remember the reason. I think the reason I can\u2019t is because she decided to throw me outside for the night while it was snowing. I was in a tank top and pajama bottoms. I was only 9, and I had to spend around 3 hours until my uncle stopped by at around 11, and saw me. I don\u2019t remember much after that. It\u2019s memories like these that I try to push down., and that was just one of the horrible things I\u2019ve had to experience. I\u2019ve been abused both emotionally and physically, I\u2019ve spent the last 3 years in therapy, and I haven\u2019t seen my mom in the last 2 years. I know people will say that \u201cyou\u2019re young, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d but it isn\u2019t the case. I grew up in an abusive household. Trauma like this will never go away. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be truly ok. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be truly happy again, either. But everyday I try to tell myself, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be ok, just pretend to be happy and you\u2019ll be fine!\u201d But everyday my feelings get worse and worse. I don\u2019t know what to do sometimes, and honestly I don\u2019t know if there is anything I can do. I just keep pushing forward in life, because really that\u2019s all I can do.",
        "6722": "Yes, I have experienced this prior to COVID and during the pandemic. It changed me a lot from the person I was before. But I recently started therapy hoping to cope with these conditions. It\u2019s not an easy fight but I don\u2019t want to give up on myself. I have a lot to offer to this world.\n\n\nI used to attend a university I transferred to in fall 2019. But needless to say I had a bad semester. I wasn\u2019t a bad student I always did my work and I have graduated from CC with 4.0 and got a scholarship to pay for most of my education. But I ended up with instructors that weeded the course work so much, half the classes were failing. The advisors were not so helpful nor was the student services. I was struggling both academically and socially because I find it hard to fit in a population of 40k students. I left because I knew it wasn\u2019t worth my time nor money for this school but I sometimes regret that things didn\u2019t go as I expected to be.\n\nI went back to CC to make up for my poor academic performance by taking fewer classes. But that\u2019s when the pandemic started. The moment when everything changed in bullet time. I did passed my classes but it was hard to get use to the online normality. Just as I was planning to transfer elsewhere my grandfather passed away in the summer 2020. Again, another moment that really changed me. I had no choice but to drop out of school for a year to clear my mind from all this. \n\nChristmas time was the worst, I ended up with Covid and was forced to spend quarantine alone. It was very lonely and I was at the point where I became suicidal.\n\nI know all of it was from the past but I still feel depressed and have no idea what to do after this nightmare ends.

After an easy birth I suffered from extreme post partum, depression and anxiety. \n\n I lost my dream of art school and photojournalism to a haze of depression and medication.  I took almost 15 years of drugs and therapy to get to the point where I was fit to raise my son.  I still struggle daily and am on government supports.  \n\nWhile I don't regret my life, I love my child, I do wish I had done things differently.  I feel like I'm making up for so much lost time.

I've had 7 of them and they've all cried when I related stuff I thought was tame and more or less normal. I am terrified of having kids because while I won't hit them, I'm worried I'll say something fucked up and not even know I did anything wrong. My perception is so warped from the abuse that I don't understand love and intimacy. I probably do love some people. I have felt sad when people I knew died. But it's possible to row a boat without understanding the physics of how it floats. I feel like that's what I'm doing. I don't understand what I'm doing by loving others, but I do love them.

        "6731": "Yes, especially when it came to relationships",
        "6732": "Yes. I also believe I may be keeping myself sick to some extent. I have addictive behaviors (4 yrs sober now) and was tsking about this issue to a friend who specializes in sobriety techniques. She shined a light on how it is possible that because of my addictive personality, I have become at peace with the bad thoughts that trigger my depression. That I have to an extent accepted them as part of who I am now, just like when I was addicted to drugs and alcohol. I had become obsessed with my diagnosis, always telling myself inside my head that I\u2019m depressed, ocd, GAD etc. So I think I am addicted to the thought of being sick. If I can quit drugs and alcohol, I can quit the bad thoughts. I am working on meditation self care yoga excercise and vegan eating (oops I had sushi today with mom, couldn\u2019t resist). I\u2019m taking some time off work to clear my head and focus on these things and elevating my mind state above the ego, being conscious of the language that I use and in my mind that contributes to my imbalances. I have been feeling better. But it\u2019s work just like anything else. You have to want to get better, just like I had to WANT to quit drugs and alcohol, so I did!  A good technique that I learned was giving myself credit for every accomplishment I make, and telling myself good job! Even if it is something as simple as brushing my teeth, which is next to impossible when I\u2019m severely depressed. I forced myself to hang out with a friend, and made two new friends! It feels good to have a tribe of people. I also would be conscious of how you are framing things in your mind. Instead the f thinking that you wasted so much time, focus on the fact that you recognize a problem and have the courage and love for yourself to find a way to change it. Only you are responsible for yourself, make a conscious choice to encourage yourself and gove yourself credit for all of your accomplishments and the ones you will achieve in the future. I know it is easier said than done, but I recommend a book that I\u2019m reading now called conscious language. It has some Jesus stuff in it here and there. I am not religious but even the Bible verses in there are very uplifting and helpful. We are all one, and little pieces of the same universe.

I'm not sure why they went to him instead of coming to me direct, but that's the way it went. He had a tea ready, and gave me the toughest love I've ever had. Told me that he knew shit wasn't right, and he didn't care what he had to do. We were talking about it there and then, because he had noticed I wasn't right too, and would rather have the worst discussion a parent could ever have with their kid, than find me dead with a note somewhere. Fucking laid it out right in front of me. No bullshit. Even when I tried to play it off, like a macho fucking dickhead, he just gave me a hug. Told me he knew. I let go, let everything go. Broke down like a toddler having a freak out about not getting that toy I'd just seen and instantly wanted. I TALKED. Rambled would be a better word. I spilled everything. Every feeling I had. Every thought I had. And I'm not that kind of guy at all. And do you know what? It fucking helped. I'm now seeing a counsellor, my work are giving me support. My mates are helping me through this shit time. Because I gave in and talked. Fellas, ladies, washing machines, whatever you identify as. Fucking talk to people. Because take it from me, it god damn helps, and it will fucking save your life. No matter how gone you think are. It will fucking save you. Someone out there cares for you. You are someone's thought. You are something. Just reach out. Because you are someone's something. If you're someone's stranger who just happens to be reading a reddit post, then you are someone. Get help guys, talk.

The worst feeling isn't the pain you feel when you're younger... it's the full awareness that your capacity to feel anything at all is dissipating all together and all you have are memories of when the stakes were high and you'd do anything to feel okay. It's a very strange sense of loss. I feel so detached from that poor girl in the past... but angry that nobody helped her sooner, better. She lost her life and no one will ever know because here I am.... still alive.",

It just didn't let me make one ahaha.\nNow I'm trying at 21 but I'm fucked as fuck, my head is a fucking explosiooon (cit.

Couple years later my grandmother, who took care of me when I was little, died and I couldn't finish university. And the last one was couple of months ago. Before pandemic me and my former friend opened a restaurant. But because of the restrictions. It was really struggling and I fell in the rabbit hole again. Those episodes of depression, giving up and losing will to go on cost me so much in my life. I'm turning 30 next month and feel like I wasted all my life. I lost all my friends, I can't find relationship and I'm also in debt. I don't want to use any medication and only thing that helps is marijuana but it has a lot of side effects too. So I don't use it very often. Sometimes I wake up and first thought is wishing my life was over. There is nothing that makes me happy or giving me any hope. The only reason I still live is my mother. I don't want to hurt her while she still lives.",

Having mental health issues is like combination of going to philosophy school combined with school of hard knocks. And you learn from that things \"normal\", healthy or privileged ppl don't. The thing is though, you will have the advantage since life is mostly suffering & meaningless - you need to create ur own meaning. And those ppl who havent struggled in life wont have perspective, dont appreciate the little things and will struggle when life throws obstacles on you.\n\nSo fuck yeah we are strong.... willbe eventually when we get our shit together.

Depression is a state of mind where people locked their feelings n emotions knowingly or unknowingly that's why after few days we stop recognising our feelings.

The truth is, even though I am maybe more functioning than others are able to be through their illness, I\u2019m still sick and still need help.

I\u2019ll be sad as can be and then talk to another depressed person and it always seems like their \u201creasons\u201d for being depressed are so much more valid than my own.

        "6984": "I honestly don't know why people like me. But it does come as a shock when it seems like people actually want to talk with me",
        "6985": "Yeah.  I mean, I'm still in the woods so to speak, as I tend to isolate for extended periods of time and don't really have any solid relationships.  I've never heard this from anyone, but it's on my mind a lot.  Like, idk if you can relate to this, and I can't articulate why exactly right now, but when you reflect for long enough as to why exactly *you* are boring, and more boring than anyone else, eventually you reach the conclusion that it's not really founded in reason and can only seem to be explained as an illusion of your mind as a repressed fear of rejection.  Your unconscious will go to extreme lengths to protect yourself from ostracism (think evolutionarily; you're fighting for survival), but it is so strong your assumptions as to where you 'stand' are so pessimistic that it is really difficult to challenge them.\n\nIn essence, it really isn't very rational: you look at people and try to deduce what exactly it is that would make *you* want to hang out with *them*, and then try to figure out why it is what it is you're missing, and it's quite difficult.  But until you can change it with long-term habituation, it's really a very powerful illusion, not least because even if you can disprove it, you can't prove another alternative and you're left in the dark so to speak.  You really have to just take a leap of faith with these things and be prepared to fail.",

        "6989": "Struggled with this quite a bit lately, think it causes me to freeze and not really take any initiative with people I haven't already known closely for a long time. Like the whole perspective I have in my head is \"sure, if you really want to\" about things like hanging out and talking etc, but in my head I also don't want to bother them with if I were to ask the same thing. I know for sure that its in my head at least 90% of the time, recently especially i was told over and over how it was great that I'm around and given heaps of compliments etc. \n\nHonestly my over worrying might be costing me someone who seems pretty great because I've been feeling pretty frantic over it. They showed a lot of interest in me, but because I'm way too hypervigilant that they would eventually realize how much I suck it feels excruciating trying to take the initiative lol. I'm actually very comfortable when the other person sets the pace but its clear enough this person is waiting for me to. Realistically I know that any of what I worry about probably wouldn't happen if I could get over these beliefs. Its the beliefs that are holding me back. Maybe its time I start doing CBT journals and worksheets again and working on someone of these thoughts and feelings that have been popping up since I started being social again",
        "6990": "All the time! And the irony is that I am a social worker, specifically a youth crisis counselor. I'm told all the time that I am a great guy, and I have no enemies. I just think I'm a bit weird, and my interests aren't really \"shareable\" (True Crime) So if somebody *really* gets to know me I always think \"Okay, they are still here...\"\n\nYou're not alone. Also... as an aside. The older you get the more difficult it is to find friends. So do it while you're in your 20s or in college/university. All my friends I've known for 10 to 15 years. The rest are acquaintances.",
        "6991": "Yeah, but ultimately people like who they like. They like who they feel connected to. Sometimes you can\u2019t really explain that connection, except that we tend to like people who we feel familiar to in some sense. Or someone that has something we feel we lack. Also, people\u2019s perception of us are a lot different than our perception of ourselves. Be easy on yourself!",

My first thought when someone o wants to spend time with me is never 'oh they must like me' it's 'they must be bored/trying to get away from their house/have nothing else to do'.

For example: \u201cI admire the way you interact with people\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re very poetic\u201d.

And when I try to make a joke it\u2019s somehow less funny than my actual personality. I\u2019m a sucker for bad jokes what can I say? \n\nAlso, I never really considered myself outgoing but somehow people think I am, and I do talk to a lot of people but only because I either have to or they want to talk to me and I don\u2019t mind.

        "7051": "Yes!! I understand. Here are something I think will help which I\u2019ve been implementing in my life.(if you want advice!)\n1. The main thing is lack of self love. Instead of forcing yourself to love yourself(physically, mentally, anyway) learn to accept it. An example is, I was insecure of having a small chest. I made a list of pros and instead of hating I would say \u201cI accept my body and what it\u2019s done for me to keep me alive and healthy.\u201d On days I felt v insecure. Of course I still have days where I\u2019m insecure but for the most part, I have come to terms and accept my small chest. It feels incredibly freeing to accept something about yourself and not care rather than forcing yourself to love it and feel like you\u2019re lying.\n2. Look at maslow's hierarchy of needs\n[maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=maslow's%20hierarchy%20of%20needs&iax=images&ia=images&iai=http://www.nosmokeandmirrors.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Maslows-Hierarchy-of-Needs.jpg) Having a solid foundation/targeting the root is always a solid step as it will make everything else go much easier. So essentially make sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep, water, food, if you\u2019re in an unhealthy environment try your best to ignore the toxicity(easier said than done).\n3. Make a list of 10 things you love about yourself. Then keep adding, try to get as many as you can. When I first made my list, it took me 10 minutes to think of 1 then I cried for three hours because I couldn\u2019t think of anything else. It took me two hours after that to get to 10. Ive been working on it since and I am now up to 90! It can be something as small as \u201cI love/like that I love cookies\u201d or \u201cwhen I sit like L from deathnote\u201d \u201cbirthmark on my cheek\u201d \u201chow I\u2019m fully attentive to people when I listen\u201d or \u201chow I enjoy gardening\u201d\n4. Whenever you see a quality in someone you like or dislike, write it down. For the things that you like, see how you can exhibit those qualities more. For the things you dislike, see if you yourself have those qualities and if so, try to find the root of them and talk to yourself like you\u2019re talking to your child self dealing with those issues.\n\nI\u2019m obviously no professional, these are things that I\u2019ve implementing into my life that have been helping!",

Don\u2019t worry about shaving (a lot of times I just get the bottom 3\u201d of each leg and my armpits every couple of days.

One for soapy water and one for rinse water.

I barely even wash my hair any more, my depressive episodes are near constant. Dry shampoo is a godsend.\n- baby wipes! If showering is too much, just giving your face, pits and ass a quick wipe down makes you feel so much better. If you don't have wipes, a facecloth will do the job just as well.\n- sit down in the shower if you have to. It's surprisingly helpful, especially when you're exhausted just by standing.\n- you can just stand in there and let the water run over you for a bit, and if that's all you can manage that's fine. Sometimes it's less about getting clean and more about feeling better. \n- febreeze your clothes, you'll feel less smelly and it freshens up the room a bit too.\n- mouthwash is easier than brushing if you don't have the energy. Alternatively, you can just brush with water, as it's more about breaking up the plaque than anything.\n- I have short hair so I don't know much about styles, but if you can do a bun they tend to look good no matter how messy.\n- possibly the most difficult of all: try not to beat yourself up about it. I still struggle to no end with bullying myself relentlessly over this kind of thing, but I promise it's ok. You're trying your best, and that's what matters.",

I\u2019d say its worth a try though\n\nEdit: you can also just play from your phone if you dont have a speaker but that feels less nice to me",

I smelled like the inside of the devil's asshole and my breath could have knocked a buzzard off of a week old corpse. Didn't care. A good friend literally dragged me into a running shower, clothes and all, and yelled at me until I cleaned myself. That was a low point, but it got better. Ot got so much better, in fact, that tomorrow my wife and I are celebrating 17 years together.

I know this is gross and probably doesn't do anything, but when I have already spent all my energy and really need to brush my teeth, I just wet my toothbrush and brush. I know you need the toothpaste, but its so disproportionally exhausting. \n\nI've had dogs with me when I sleep, but they never wanna stay in bed as long as I do and my room's in the basement so I'll shout upstairs to see if anyones up and if they are then I just let the dogs up and go back to bed. I'm always tired, but can't sleep at night. I really want to be pulled out of this episode as its been over month, but it's too hard.",

My PTSD caused so much anxiety cleaning became an obsession. I fought the depression in private and smiled and made people believe I was alright. After a time it's so exhausting you want to just give up.. \nIf it wasnt for my support network I honestly cant tell you if I would be here. I cant work because I just cant get the strength togeather. I clean when I get motivated but that runs out fast.

My beard and hair grew out 2 years with not a bit of grooming before I cut it off a few days ago. Hair kept getting in my face when I was hitting the punching bag and I got pissed off and ripped a chunk of it out. Then I shaved the rest to keep it even because while vanity isn't my thing and I'm not too concerned with my looks, that just looked really fucking stupid.\n\nI haven't picked out an outfit ever, except for work uniforms. I don't care what I'm wearing so long as it is comfortable. I wear nothing but sweatpants, pajama pants and t-shirts.

I could feel a tiny bit hungry but the idea of having to move to get food just leaves me feeling like starving would be the easier option. \n\nWhen I was holding down a full-time job though, the starting was legit the hardest part, but once I started I would work for hours straight without breaks.

I really can adapt to it my mood, peppy music if I\u2019m trying to motivate myself, sad music is if I just want to wallow in my sadness. \n\nFor me, it also functions as a way to keep track of time because when I\u2019m depressed, showers end up taking way longer because I just end up sitting down for a long time.\n\nAnd the main benefit is that it gives me something to distract myself because I hate being alone with my own thoughts when I\u2019m depressed.",

Takes me an hour or more to go from waking up to getting out of bed, and then I get lightheaded as soon as I\u2019m upright (meds), so my energy is zapped by the time I have to wash up for the morning.

Normally I'd have to scrub for hours just to make a dent in it, but when I'm depressed I just don't bother. And then there's the bathroom, which is also super gross. And just crap all over the place. Food caked over every inch of my apartment (I eat at my desk, typically with no plates or utensils), crevices behind garbage are disgusting, floor is gross, toilet/shower is gross, just...everything.\n\nI'd feel self-conscious enough that I'd \"pre-clean\" before the cleaner came, which totally defeats the purpose? :/\n\nI also live in a teeny tiny studio (400 sqft), and I'm worried the cleaner would judge me for hiring them for such a small space.",

Started to like being petted. A lot more sociable.\n\nBut the remarkable thing was, when I was sad, he would come over and nudge me with his little nose, as if trying to distract me. When I was crying, he would kind of nest up in the crook of my arm and stay until I stopped.\n\nIt kind of blew my mind how much empathy I could feel from him. My daughter moved away a couple months ago and took him with her. I miss him so much.\n\nWhat your cat did was no accident. They know. You are important to them. And that\u2019s a gift, no matter who it comes from.",

We live alone just her and I and the thought of the distress that would leave her (no food, no water, no human she trusts) honestly kept me alive for a good two months. \nThey make a bigger difference than they'll ever know. They deserve all the treats and all the pets.",

Then his cat rubs up against his leg and purrs and it snapped him out of it and he came back to reality, realizing all he has. One of the comments was \"He gave you one of his nine lives\" and it actually did make me cry.\n\nEdit: oh! Oh my God! Please listen to a song called \"Plea From a Cat Named Virtute\", it's by the band The Weakerthans and it's so good. It's from the perspective of a cat with a depressed owner. It goes:\n\n\"Why don't you ever want to play?\n\nI'm tired of this piece of string\n\nYou sleep as much as I do now\n\nAnd you don't eat much of anything\n\nI don't know who you're talking to\n\nI made a search through every room\n\nBut all I found was dust that moved\n\nAnd shadows of the afternoon\n\nAnd listen, about those bitter songs you sing?\n\nThey're not helping anything\n\nThey won't make you strong\n\nAll you ever want to do is drink and watch TV\n\nAnd frankly that thing doesn't really interest me\n\nI swear I'm going to bite you hard\n\nAnd taste your tinny blood\n\nIf you don't stop the self-defeating\n\nLies you've been repeating\n\nSince the day you brought me home\n\nI know you're strong\"",

If you attempt to hang yourself theres no guarantee you'll die you could end up worse off. I attempted suicide with pills. I died, had a near death experience and was given a choice to live or stay in the void or what I think is purgatory. I chose to live and went towards the light.

It feels almost as though she's letting me make up my mind up first so she won't make me feel guilty if I want to leave, but once I decide I want to stay she appears and reminds me she's here and loves me.",

The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise.\n\nMake no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump.

Learn from your decision and by mindful of the effects.\nCarry on and be strong my friend!",
        "7451": "Medication saved my life. Without it I'd have been dead a long time ago. I tried for a awhile to manage my bipolar with little to no medication and it was a disaster.

        "7468": "I\u2019ve never thought of medication as indication that those who take are lesser of, quite the opposite to me medication means they\u2019re getting better or getting help. I\u2019m also a firm believer that medication isn\u2019t a solution but a bandaid to the solution while figuring out how to get there. Would I ever start meds? Absolutely. If I get to the point where I need some help I will, but I will also try my very best to get safely off of them again once I started them and make a safe \u201creturn\u201d.\n\nI think it\u2019s a very stigmatized topic and I think it\u2019s one of the many topics that people are afraid to discuss, perhaps because of how people might think according to OP\u2019s experiences.\n\nThere\u2019s something weird about how all of the above sounds but I can\u2019t figure it out so sorry for my english, it\u2019s not my first language.",

It's my right to refuse medication when offered. Medication isnt a complete solution on it's own, but is beneficial alongside therapy. If I want therapy on it's own without the help of medication, then I shouldn't be made to feel like I'm being criticised for exercising my right.\n\nIt's irritating how some mental health services try and throw medication at a problem and treat therapy like more of an after thought. (Though to be fair, a lot of services are understaffed with long waiting lists.)",

One day you may even be able to walk without the crutches. Medication is not a sign of weakness, it is a sign of strength from someone accepting help.",
        "7473": "A lot of the time I\u2019ve found that people who shit on medication use other more unhealthy ways to cope, don\u2019t give up or lose hope you\u2019re doing great \ud83d\udda4",

        "7475": "I\u2019m right there with you! I watched my parents deteriorate from long term prescriptions of pain killers for chronic issues. I have always been afraid to be on medication. I am now two months in and although I\u2019m not where I want to be, I\u2019m doing better than I was. I\u2019m 30 and I\u2019ve been trying to manage my mental health issues my entire life on my own. I\u2019ve learned I\u2019m incapable and need help, and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m now see a psychiatrist, on medication, and seeking therapy.. and that\u2019s OK!",

It\u2019s definitely a nuanced thing with mental health. A diagnosis is already so stigmatized and to have to take medication to manage it is seen as even worse. It\u2019s so dumb. That\u2019s like saying I shouldn\u2019t have to take medicine for my allergies. I should just be able to manage it without.",

I am dealing with depression and have people around me who are supportive and encouraging but sometimes it's just not enough. Though I can't take anti-depressants due to certain medical problems I am certain that if I could have, I definitely would have. Why wouldn't I want to be better? Sometimes it's wise and better to not fight it all alone you know.\n\nAnd considering you have kids who depend on you, your health be it physical or mental is important. I agree with you a 100% you are not a loser to choose yours and your family's well being.",
        "7479": "It's extremely ignorant for anybody to view a person that has chosen the route of taking medication as being less than victorious.

        "7488": "I hear you, and I\u2019m definitely not suggesting a person should depend on meds alone, but I feel like the stigma is more anti meds than it is pro bettering oneself. I tried \u201cbettering myself\u201d without the meds and that didn\u2019t exactly go well for me as I ended up in hospital. So for me and a suspect a great deal of people the meds are quite the game changer.",

There\u2019s -always- going to be someone in worse shape; we can\u2019t use that as a metric for getting ourselves help. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re going to see someone, I truly hope you open yourself up to all of the tools there are for healing.

Think about this: despite your back pain, despite how horrible you felt on THIS day, you stood at the bell.

The fact that you realize that you need to change; now THAT'S where it resonates. That's the concept that will start to change you. The guilt you feel knowing that you could have done better is there to HELP YOU change. Listen to it, but don't hold onto it. There's no need. Accept that you have the potential to feel happy, to live with good health, and to be satisfied when your head hits the pillow. It will happen.\n\nYou know what to do, and you know it will be difficult. But the reason you feel this way is because you deserve better. I'm so sorry that you have to deal with back pain, and I can't imagine the difficulty that comes from the pain meds. I do know just like so many others that you can get through this, and it sounds like you know it too. Just take that first baby step, whatever it may be. A day without alcohol, a nice mile jog, a walk, eating clean for a meal, whatever. Get after it.\n\nTrust me, we all like easy things, and yes, life can be dreadfully hard sometimes. But the harder you try at the beginning with those little victories, the easier the routine gets, the happier you become.   \n\n\nI know it doesn't feel like it, but if you sublimate the pain you felt today and use it make tomorrow better, then today was a victory. \n\nI believe in you, and thank you so much for having the courage to post this. It helps others, whether you know it or not. \n\nShoot me a message if you need any more support!!",

And you don't even start doing it because you know it's not going to be \"good enough\"? That's some kind of procrastination type, but hear this, you're so aware you have to do the right thing, - but know you may not do it perfectly - and you don't do it at all. Because is better not doing it at all than dissapoiting yourself for performing it poorly, right? Lemme free you from that guilt. Maybe you didn't eat healthy all day, but you made yourself some fruit with yogurt and oats and juice, and ate a good dinner. Half good, right? But it's enough, tomorrow maybe you could eat a healthy breakfast and then got low on energy and then just ate doritos. But it's fine, keep trying. The next day you cooked for three days, ate good breakfast and you didn't ate late. That's perfect ! Maybe it wasn't the fanciest meal, who cares? You're surviving, you're getting better, perfect performance can go to shit. Be proud of everything you do.\n\nDid 10 minutes of work out, couldnt move at all, got tired inmeadiatly, maybe I made that excercise wrong. WHO CARES? It's much better than nothing at all. Your body learns, it accomodates, you become more awake, your breathing gets stronger, next day you did twenty minutes with some music that keept you motivated, your body is in the floor, your heart aches, you breathing is heavier, it might be painful, but it reminds you that you're alive, it's amazing you can feel all of these little tingles in your body, right? Feel yourself, you own this.\n\nForgive yourself, accept your depression, move on, slowly, fail, fail again, try again, get reminded you're alive, that little moment of blessing was worth all the effort. Then try again, those little moments keep accumulating, then everything feels like it makes you aware you're alive, you don't even have to try, or overthinking it too much, and even reaching this point, you may fail again, but it's ok ! You're human and trying and you have every right to keep trying. You forgave yourself and accepted yourself and you can keep doing it forever, it's all worth these few seconds of chills in your body that make you feel like being alive is a blessing and existing is euphoric as it is!

If I try to force myself, I dissociate, have a mental breakdown, and my brain shuts off. When I'm past that point, it's like telling a lame man to walk.

I've struggled with being extremely lethargic and low energy, taking long naps throughout the day, and then having bursts of energy every week or two where I tried to get my life together and be a normal, healthy person. I remember the ravine-- it usually felt like I was sitting or lying next to it, not about to fall, but the danger was always present. \n It impacted my life a lot: I slept through classes, didn't eat when I should have because I didn't want to go through the process of making myself a meal, and skipped social events because I was tired. I eventually talked to my doctor about it, who recommended some blood tests for things like blood cell count and thiamine levels. When they all came back negative, it was a relief in some ways, but good to know that I could fix it with my mental health. \n\nThe best advice I can give is to reframe the question-- feeling like the only way to get better is to buck up and force yourself to be healthy can be really counterproductive. It just adds on guilt, and creates a \"healthy\" vs \"unhealthy\" dichotomy. \n\nThe way I got myself through that was reconnecting with my sense of joy and wonder about the world. Cultivating gratitude for the smallest things does wonders-- it's like a muscle, the more you think that way the more natural and authentic it is. I cut out naps-- now I just have a quiet moment to myself instead of falling asleep. Consider your feelings of guilt, and try to disconnect from that. I like to aim for consistency rather than perfection, so I don't feel bad if I didn't do my laundry, exercise, study, look at my finances all in one day. Just one of those things once a week is a success!",

Why would you logically try if you've convinced yourself being mentally healthy is near impossible and takes so much effort? You're doing the SANE thing to just ignore that line of thinking and drink vodka instead. \n\nBut obviously, that's not what we want out of life. So you have to convince yourself it's not impossible. You don't reach a point of being perfect when it comes to life. Thinking you will and it's just a matter of working hard enough to get there can lead to some toxic patterns. It did for me for a loooong time. \n\nWhat helped were those baby steps, yes, but I had to shower myself with praise when I accomplished one small thing (like, taking out the trash. And not just tying it and letting it sit there, but actually taking it down and moving the can to the curb). And then I SMOTHER myself with love and praise and encouragement. I did it! I am so freaking proud of myself!! Yes!! I finished a task!!\n\nAnd then I did another small task. And another. Etc. \nBut I slid back into patterns, which is often, I try not to let negativity grab me but instead say, it's ok, I have been tired today, what can I do instead? And slowly, your mind remembers these positive patterns and naturally goes there instead of the negative.\n\nThe lack of energy, that feeling of sand, definitely sounds like depression. Energy is the currency of mental health. If you can find a way to trick your brain to get that energy back, you are on the right track. \n\nGood luck my friend. I'm proud of you. And you should be too.\n\nEdits: stupid autocorrect",

You are not alone, and the reason you probably asked the question is because like me you were insecure at one point in time about it.\n\nIt could be: \nStress and cortisol due to everyday life. With a person that has mental illness it exacerbates the symptoms of stress. Everyone gets stressed, but few tend to understand that mental illness actually makes some people actually seem straight forgetful, disorganized, irritated, tired and can also give people coordination issues. \n\nI have some weird chronic fatigue issues with depression and it makes everything terrible. People have actually told me about my memory issues and it makes me very insecure. Now people can run their mouths all day about advice, but really the best thing you can do is to slowly recover through multiple ways:\n\n- Sleep health is very important.\n- Vitamins and nutrition\n- Lower stress and meditate\n- Exercise\n- Don't isolate yourself, this can actually have drastic effects on your functioning.\n- Find soft hobbies or companies, maybe pets to occupy or stimulate your mind\n- Self compassion\n\nNow worst is that you don't feel anything, but it can only help. And yes I understand when people say these things are easy, especially to someone with severe anxiety, it appears somewhat disingenuous... *Did it work for them?* I would say to myself.

I have never in my life been one to nap, but I have taken more naps in the last six months than in my entire life. \n\nA couple weeks ago I was debating taking a three hour trip to a certain place to get a certain food and breathe some fresh air. I took a friday off to go an do it, but on thursday, I woke up and thought I should go after work instead. \n\nINSTANTLY, I was filled with energy and purpose! I jumped out of bed, got all of my work done  early, and hit the highway! \n\nMy sluggishness was gone because I decided to make it go away because I decided to do something I wanted to do. \n\nYou can do the same thing. \n\nIn addition, you have incentive to do it because if you are letting people down, you need to talk to yourself and get some energy and purpose going.

        "7936": "Hi fellow MDD/GAD sufferer /s \n\nI'm somewhat in recession regarding my depression I think (not sure how long it has to be to be called that way, but after years I've had more than a month very stable) I get very frustrated because I know I was sharper and faster-thinking before depression set in, and finding myself forgetting stuff in a minute makes me feel really stupid. Careful with that though, because it creates a vicious cycle.\n\nAnyway. Yes the meds and the depression cause cognitive issues. Bah, the meds tend to make you drowsy and spaced out as they are meant to calm you down. I've relatively recently have read a few studies in which they track that even after achieving remission the cognitive symptoms can linger for many months after, but it's not something doctors seem to address very much in practice as the first priority is get you into remission. \n\nI spoke about it with my doctor and he says yes it is true, but once your stressors are better managed there can be slow improvement. I've been using one of those apps that have puzzles and activities for brains but I haven't used it consistently enough to give you a review. That said now that I haven't been depressed for a while I'm proud to say I picked up the first fiction book in nearly a decade  (the Blade Runner novel) and finished it in three days or so like it was the most normal thing and I was able to read normal without getting spaced out. So something got better now that my depression symptoms are at bay. I do get worse when anxious too, so I take it very seriously to stay away from known stressors that aren't necessary and make sure I have me time and stuff like that. \n\nHope that gives you some optimism.",
        "7937": "I suffered from anxiety and I felt like my mind was racing so much during the day it was too tired to do anything productive. Learning to calm myself down helped. I learned mindfulness and CBT which seemed to help me quiet my mind. \n\nOne of my friends who had depression said she became very forgetful. She found that getting out of the house and going for a walk (anything that got the blood flowing and oxygen to the brain) helped her a bit.",
        "7938": "Hey,\n\nFirst of all, I'm sorry you feel that way. Yes, I know how you feel. I suffer from anxiety and mild depression. I have gone through some tough things lately and they have a taken a toll on my mental health. But my mantra is that I won't let my trauma define my life for me. In other words, I do not want to give it power over my life. I'm not saying you can ever forget it but you can come to terms with where you are able to live life without it impacting your life in a negative way. It's easier said than done for sure. I was constantly thinking about what other people think of me but I read somewhere that I should live the life I want, not how other's think I should. Perhaps at the end of my life, I want to look back and be happy with the life I chose to live. Other people might have their opinions but only you know whats best for you. Remember, you are the one who has to deal with the consequences and/or benefits of the decisions you make. So make them based on what you think is best for you, not what other people think. I used to hold back from things (that aren't bad at all tbh, like for honest if I want to wear makeup) because I thought other people would judge me. But tbh I am happy when I wear makeup and if other people have a problem with it, it says something about them and not me. I know that's a silly example, possibly but hopefully you get my point. I am not telling you that you should not listen to other people but become more aware of the difference between genuine advice and unnecessary judgement. I did not notice that I got more forgetful and felt more stupid. To help with my forgetfulness, I got a planner that I used to plan my weeks and that I looked at everyday. It had a checklist in it. It honestly transformed my life. It's a small thing but it made a big difference. I was able to manage my time better. Another thing that helped me was to incorporate yoga and/or exercise at a particular time. Having a daily routine made things come naturally to me. I would totally recommend you set a daily routine that you don't have to follow rigidly the first few times but eventually you get the hang of it. As for feeling stupid, those are just FEELINGS. I read a book by a therapist and she made this point that feeling uncomfortable is normal to humans. The only difference between those who are confident and insecure is how they interpret this feeling. Insecure people see it as a FACT to their lack of intelligence and skills while confident people realize that it's just a feeling. She recommended that you make a list of all the accomplishments you've made in your life. They are evidence and a testament to your achievements and intelligence. Sometimes when our mental health is not in the right place, our minds give more weight to the negative things in our life despite all the tremendous amount of positive things in our life. Also, she recommended that whenever you get a negative thought or feeling, just actively talk yourself through it and tell yourself that it's okay to feel like this but it does not say anything about your intelligence. If I did bad on a presentation, instead of \"I did bad because I'm stupid\" I should think like \"My presentation could have been better but it's okay. I still gave it my best I could. I'll try to do better next time\". I also journal a lot especially when I'm stressed out. The number of times I have cried because of a thought and then I journal and everything becomes so clear. I don't know how to explain it but it's like I'm freewriting my thoughts on paper and as I keep doing so, things become clearer and clearer. I hope this helps you. If you want to talk more about this, I can try to give you more suggestions but these are the ones that have helped me the most. Also, know that you are not the only one who feels like this. Ironically, knowing that makes us feel less insecure about ourselves.",

A few days later, I asked him if he had seen the link I posted months ago according to me, and I posted the song again, and he goes, \"You posted this last Friday\", and I'm like \"What?\" :P :P :P I was super depressed then, and I wasn't keeping track of time. I really think our minds are too tired to keep track of things that aren't necessary according to it! My memory is fine btw. It still didn't remember when I posted that. I think memory exercises might help! There was a time when we used to remember phone numbers, now we kind of don't. We are getting a little lazy, we should also do stuff to improve our memory!   \n\n\nAs for you, you're perfect the way you are! You're amazing, and that doesn't diminish based on the ability of others to see it! :)  \n\n\nYou said that you were depressed!  I really think you need to take a break, try to understand what you want from life! Try to connect to yourself. Try to understand why you feel what you feel! It might be scary at first, but just because it's hard and scary doesn't mean it's bad, you know? It's like untying a knot! Life's about being happy! To be happy, you should get to a state in which you are not depressed. To get there, you need to ask your mind questions, why you feel what you feel, things like that!  \n\n\nIf your job is toxic to you, you should quit! If there are people that affect you in a bad way, you're allowed to not want them in your life! Don't do anything you don't like doing! All of these things affect you in a bad way!  \n\n\nConnect to yourself! Ask yourself what you want from life! :) Life's about being happy, and doing what you love! Life's about having fun, and spending time with your loved ones! Life's about finding out what you're passionate about, and doing it! You're one in seven billion! You're perfect the way you are! Everyone's great at something, and everyone can be great at something if they do what it takes! Everyone is a genius in their own way! If you haven't found out what you're passionate about, keep looking! Here's the thing, people love watching passionate people do their thing! Whether it's streaming games, or singing, or whatever! Do something you want to do in life! Follow your passion! Follow your heart! If you do what you're passionate about, everyday, when you wake up, you'll embrace the day instead of going \"Ugh, I have to work today\", you know? It might not be sunshine and rainbows all the time, but it's something you want!  \n\n\nYou're perfect the way you are! We should always accept ourselves for who we are. If there's something you don't like about yourself, you can change it, but only for yourself, not for others. Others should accept you for who you are! You should accept others for who they are! Always be yourself!   \n\n\nIt's important to understand that there are things out of our control, and one shouldn't worry about things that we can't do anything about! What we do have control over, we can do something, so we shouldn't worry as much!  \n\n\nI really wish this helped! :) Everything's going to be okay! :) I'm here if you ever need someone to talk to! :)",

Especially when there\u2019s a chemical imbalance involved.\n\nStill, there is a way to deal with knowing things most people do not. I like to look around and laugh. Because it really is all so ridiculous when you think about it. Here we are on a rock in space spinning around a massive nuclear fusion reactor. Everything that is eventually will not be. Everyone gets sick, gets old, and eventually dies. And there\u2019s noting that I can actually find wrong with any of that. Why would there be anything wrong with anything in the grand scheme of things?\n\nThe world used to get more depressing the more I read and payed attention to the news.

It takes one life to make change, one life to save a life,  one life to support another and one persons will to be better than what humans think you are capable of.

The more I learn about how great this place is, the greater this place seems.\n\nWhat I've learned is that there's good and bad stuff happening all the time, but the sum of our reality is truly amazing. The case of our existence, organisms composed by elements from space through 13.8 billion years, are still evolving and expanding.\n\nI sometimes imagine a \"timelapse\" of earth and the moon next too each other through time. Suddenly a small metal container exits earths atmosphere, headed for the moon with apes inside clicking buttons. For the fun of it, imagine our universe is some kind of simulation done by intelligence that returns to check the results, saying \"What the hell is going on here...\"\n\nThe nature of our reality\u2014a complex mathematical equation of particles\u2014has gotten to the point where it asks questions about its existence. Asking questions like \"Where do we come from? What are the rules of the universe?\" is like a program realizing it's a program, not knowing how it started and where and when it ends.\n\nI don't think our world is depressing at all. Because we humans have developed technology to connect with each other globally through social media and internet, our perception of disaster is greater than ever. I'm betting we are much safer today than those who lived 100.000 years ago, 2.000 years ago and 200 years ago. We are never gonna be satisfied with our reality, and that is also one of the biggest reasons we have consistently pushed forward since the beginning of our existence.\n\nI'll let our ego spill out here; humans seems to be the most promising organism in this galaxy to understand what the hell is going on.

Read up on existentialism or the other schools of thought.\n\nWhat might help you is to know that whichever way you are thinking - you can change it. How? Well, terribly simple, but not very known - you just practice thinking 'out loud' (in your head) to yourself the way you want to think, if you wanna like something - maybe your first reaction is to dislike it - but always have a narrative 'out loud' in your head afterwards that corrects it or is the way you wanna feel about it. If you hate somebody, but know they are not bad, every time you hate on them - always talk yourself out of it and remind yourself of what you truly believe, look at the good qualities you like in them, think of how hard something might be on them for them to react in a certain way, think of how they just might not know better and how it's not really their fault.   \nThat's your structure for everything - whatever you want to be, however you want to think - practice it in your head. After a few weeks you'd notice something amazing - the way you were thinking before will be replaced automatically by the way you tried thinking.\n\nWorks like a charm and works on everything!\n\n(Also works for empathy - if you wanna be more empathetic - practice an inner monologue of what you appreciate in the people you see - after a few weeks - it would be You and it would happen automatically!)\n\nHope this helps!",

All we can do with it is what actions we take. Do we cling to the pain, or do we learn to let it go? \nSocial media shows us what is happening at a VERY concentrated level so it feels like everything is wrong, but really we must pay attention to our surroundings and ourself first and foremost then it won't be so bad. \n\nAs children, we did not know the ways of the world, and as we get older, we see more and it will keep going like that until you find a way to cope with it.

There are solutions to most problems and it takes passionate intelligent people to solve them!

Humans to me can\u2019t get anymore interesting. We have histories and stories of great conquerors such as Alexander the Great to philosophers who completely changed western philosophy like Rene Descartes. It\u2019s truly amazing the amount we\u2019ve accomplished good and bad. And even the bad is interesting to me. Concepts like how we began to even form civilizations from ideas like social contract to other ideas. The list goes on and on, looking at societal structures, political groups and movements, colonization, ect. These things may be good and evil but they\u2019re apart of human nature, and understanding the complexity of us is truly fascinating.

When I felt more comfortable in my clothes/body it was easier to go out and I realized that people weren't looking at me nearly as often as it felt like they were. \n\nSome people actually go the opposite direction with clothes/makeup. You could try dressing up in something more outrageous to stand out. It works for some people because even though people are seeing your outer appearance, they're not really seeing you.

There were so many things I avoided doing- going through drive-thru's, medical or dental appointments, shopping at certain places, movie theaters, large parties or get-togethers. I worked for a large company for many years and the thought of going in the breakroom caused so much anxiety that I avoided it. I remember how rough everything was. Thankfully, my day-to-day life and my ability to do daily activities has improved so much with therapy and the right medication. I still have bad days where I kind of \"hibernate\", but there are more good than bad, thankfully. You're definitely not alone in feeling how you do.",
        "8077": "I'm exactly the same! I really struggle to go outside and do things by myself. I'm so used to going outside with my mum and my mum doing things for me when I suddenly had to do things myself I was terrified. I got bullied a lot and left alone by almost everyone for years had developed an extreme distrust in everyday people. I'm so scared someone is going to jump out and attack me or insult me for no reason. Reading Karen stories and stories of people jumping out and verbally attacking for no reason I think reaffirms my fears even though they're fun to read...",
        "8078": "I have gone through periods like this before. I dont want to go out in public because I dont want to be seen. I dont want to be judged, i dont want people thinking im ugly, i dont want to be looked at, I dont want to be vulnerable. Like you said, invisible. The only thing in the moment that feels right is to stay hidden away in the protection of your home. For me the extreme of that is tucked away in my room in bed and under the covers. invisible and hidden. What has helped for me when I get into this way of thinking is to remind myself that LITERALLY STRANGERS DO NOT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING IM DOING OR WHAT I LOOK LIKE! Everyone is too involved with themselves to hyperfocus on you. No one is judging when you walk past them, are standing in line at a restaurant, checking out at a store, waiting for an uber, laying under the sun at a park, browsing, shopping, running, eating, laughing, smiling, NONE OF IT!!!! and if someone is, it will be for 3 seconds max and by the next day they will forget about it forever. This is what I tell myself when I start wanting to feel invisible and hide. People are too selfish to judge me. I hope that this helps you in some way. Ive had to tell myself this over and over, but im so glad i did. Its such a small thing but it goes a long way to just say to yourself: \u201cstrangers do not care.\u201d",

And when i back in my country, i became from that person to an outsider who goes to the mall or do anything outside, where i couldnt stay in house inside. because i felt it going to get me crazy again..... Now, my bigget problem is i got anxiety around girls, i cant look them in the eyes directly. i just felt like chicken. maybe thats why i dont have any girlfriend for almost 8 years. no offense they find me as a good looking guy or as they thought would be. but for my side i am so insecure that when i see myself in the mirror, i see so many defects with my face or my body( hands too long, i thought my arms was thin) things those.  \n\nif anyone can give me advice that would be life changing for me indeed.",

I\u2019m an easy target even for the teachers. Last couple jobs I\u2019ve had have all been ruined by people pushing me around or egging me on... I just walk away.\nBut I\u2019m stuck in my room afraid to even talk because I\u2019ll say something to offend or creep Somone out. I tried to get help and the therapist was kinda snappy at me because I missed the first appointment due to a Schedualing error. I haven\u2019t went back. I haven\u2019t talked to my doctor Last time they put me on meds that had me hearing voices.

You were right when you said you know you need to keep going out, just make it on your terms until you\u2019re more comfortable challenging yourself.

        "8098": "This is pretty relatable to me. I hate going outside because of that same reason. I feel like people are staring at me but not in a good way, even if they aren't, and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I used to get so much anxiety during gym class, it was the worst thing. I would feel like crying cause I would feel so scared being around people, especially when the activities began. It was worst when we either had to play volleyball, basketball or just walk around the gym. I would always walk around caus eI didn't have anyone to play with and I'm really shy around people unless they show that they are nice. I don't know why I was so afraid of getting hit by a ball, it literally felt like if I got hit by a ball (which I did multiple times) It would be the worst thing that could happen. I guess I felt like people would laugh at me or that they would be doing it on purpose. I don't really know what might help with these kinds of things but music does help a lot. I would keep my head down a lot but try to keep your head up as much as possible.",
        "8099": "I am. I fear other people, I especially fear what they think/say about me - So I get really bad, when I walk past 2 or more people. I fear that  they are whispering about me, point and laugh at me, going to shout snarky comments at me or maybe even get physical at me. It has even come that far, that now I also fear to take public transports, like the bus and train, because I fear what kind of people that are in there. It really sucks since I love being outside. Especially in the nature areas, like the forest, park and beach. Unfortunately in these places a lot of young people get together in big crowds, and drink in the summertime in my town",
        "8100": "I can recommend some meditation and practice mindfulness, I used to have panic attacks all the time and then I started to meditate and helped a lot, you need to realize panic attacks and anxiety are generated because of the way your brain has been wired subconsciously by some form of trauma that has happened before, you can unlearn this patterns and re-wire your brain so you can have normal behaviors in any situation you\u2019re in.\nI know you can do it, don\u2019t be afraid anymore, there\u2019s no use to it.",

I know that I liked to go outside when I was younger, and I'm not sure if I've stopped enjoying it, but nowadays I only go outside when it's necessary to walk my dog or whatever. When I do I wear dark sunglasses, keep my hair in my face, look down at the sidewalk, just try to hide myself overall. If I can avoid going outside at all, I will. I don't like people looking at me. You're not alone. :) I like that it's not weird to wear a mask everywhere now.",

Usually we come back within 20-25 minutes.. this usually helps me to not be scared outside.. i hope this was helpful?",

I was teaching piano and guitar lessons and basically forgot how to converse with adults in public even though it was something I was so good at before.

But just know it\u2019s not \u2018your fault\u2019 your mothers issues are her own and do not have to be yours, and they are also not at the fault of you. You are a human and deserve to be in this world just like anyone else! \nJust think when you see your roommates I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t think terrible things about them, so it\u2019s most likely they don\u2019t mind you at all either! We are human we make sounds! as long as you\u2019re not actively banging and smashing things about normal noises are absolutely fine! None of us live in complete silence! And if they didn\u2019t want to live with other people they could always rent a smaller place to themselves or move out! Your existence isn\u2019t a bother! Your existence matters. You have permission to be comfortable and live. Focus on the human experience and possibilities. I like spinning in the rain, feeling my hair and face get wet jumping bare foot on the grass. It helps me feel alive! Perhaps focus on these things too! :) \nthanks for messing me!",

So I guess we have to put our focus on what we do have or perhaps the physical abilities our bodies allow us to do, the memories we can make, the feelings we can experience. Such as the raindrops from the sky onto our face, running in a field, climbing a tree! Smelling your fav perfume, commenting on someone\u2019s post so they don\u2019t feel alone and you can be heard! Sometimes I try to remind myself of the human experience rather than appearance. You can attract the energy you give out!",

As someone with depression, anxiety and ADHD, I  don\u2019t have a job I haven\u2019t learnt how to drive yet and I struggle to be productive at home too. I live at home with my family so I don\u2019t even have to go out to get food. So it\u2019s like how do I learn how to live? Someone in the comments said their husband made a pros and cons list to going outside, perhaps that will help us realise why going outside can be more helpful! \nAlso it helps me to try and think of the human experience, making memories, experiencing new things. What our shells allow us to do rather than what they \u2018look like\u2019 easier said than done I know, but a start at the least!",

You didn\u2019t have to share your story! But you did, because we are in this together! I hope things become better for you, you deserve to be here, and no Karen can take that from you!",
        "8122": "Yes this is definitely important to remember! No one thinks about us more than we are thinking about ourselves in relation to being that random stranger in the street. Sometimes I like to look at people and see them as stories, everyone has their individual life, individual experiences and stories. I used to tell myself this too actually. I used to be so lively if I wanted to sing to a song I would, if I wanted to dance in the street I would, if I wanted to spin in the sunlight I would. Because I didn\u2019t see the point of holding myself back from my human experience when I found joy in the little things! That car that passes by does not care, that person who saw me soaking up the sun will probably not even see me again. And most of all, we have permission and we are aloud to live!! We just like them are a human in this world. Thank you for helping try to get back into this mindset! I am happy it has helped you so much, I hope it continues to do so :)",

        "8126": "I\u2019m glad that it has been helping you. I think another good thing to do is, even if something does happen, no one will focus on it as much as we do! Think about it you see someone trip over, I personally don\u2019t think Ha ha look at them they suck! I\u2019d just think oops hope they\u2019re okay. And then naturally people forget about it. No one is going to keep thinking about the random person they saw trip. I also like to think of embarrassing moments as funny stories to tell, or adding to the basic adventure of a day!! Ahaha remember that time I did this!! It doesn\u2019t define us as a human it just adds to our experiences:)",

It's like I want to wear a nice dress for once and I feel very happy in it, since most of my life I've been a tomboy and don't really wear many girly things.

I am glad to hear that you make yourself go out even when it\u2019s hard, because the only way is through. But of course it\u2019s okay if some days it is too much, we can just focus on the times we can. I also like to think of it as a human experience which I have mentioned over and over to people on here! Focus on the physical experiences of being out like the wind or the sun, or even the rain, the smells, the way you walk bring the attention to the details of being human! \u263a\ufe0f best of luck to you!",

I\u2019ve been telling people on here to focus on the human experience, rather than ourselves. For example how the sensations feel around us, the rain on our skin, the bushes we brush past, the smells, what noises? Can we hear the birds, the cars, I wonder where the cars are going... etc! This can help you focus on the earthly experiences rather than bringing attention to feeling anxious about ourselves!",

Such as the smells, the sounds we can hear, can we hear birds? What\u2019s the weather like? Am I warm? is the cold air biting my skin? Ooh what does the sky look like today etc... it can help take the edge off sometimes.",
        "8134": "Ahah right? Let\u2019s be grateful for our homes :) \nBut also I think it\u2019s nice to be able to go out when we may need to. And focusing on the experience of being human! Such as feeling the breeze, the rain, listening to the birds or traffic etc. \u263a\ufe0f",
        "8135": "I also can't be around the opposite gender or look at girls straight in the eyes. I sometimes do the same thing when it comes to looking at myself, I start to compare myself with other girls and my self-esteem gets very low. When you see yourself in the mirror and see things that you don't like, instead of criticising yourself try to see what you could do to change things a bit. If you don't like how your arms are thin, you can try eating a bit more or maybe do some exercises to improve your arms. You can think about the positive things about yourself like how you have long arms, you can reach things that are higher, some people can't do that. Honestly I'm a young adult that's 4'11 with a baby face and it's a bit hard sometimes but I try to find the good things about looking this way. And if you can't find any then try to think about how you are. Are you a nice person, are you honest, do you help people, stuff like that.

        "8151": "I learnt in therapy that we should allow ourselves to feel what we need, because pushing it away only puts more focus on it. However being aware of the situation and rationalising with ourselves is helpful. For example, I am embarrassed right now that felt awful. However this moment will eventually pass and whoever saw won\u2019t think much of it. If someone else fell I wouldn\u2019t be focusing on it all day. Instead of ahh I\u2019m not going to be embarrassed! I don\u2019t care about what just happened I\u2019m fine. When really that\u2019s not the case. Does that make sense? Feel what you need to feel, but remind yourself it will pass.",

I felt like I wasn't allowed to be girly either or wear dresses because of my brothers. I think I ended up as a tomboy because of them. I remember them making fun of me whenever my mom made me put on a dress when I was little, also whenever she gave me a girls toy my youngest brother wpuld laugh at me and I would end up wanting something \"cool\" like his toy. But now that I'm grown up and I wear a dress I try to leave the house as fast as I can. Sometimes the younger one would see me and wpuld say that I look nice, butbI never end up believing him.",

Please ask me questions if you aren't sure about what this disorder is and isn't. I don't mind answering sincere queries into my mind and my heart.

A lot of (rich) people are psychopaths and sociopaths but they don't go around killing people..\n\nThere is this thing called self control, and idk if you heard about it, but a lot of people should have this (tho we sometimes slip up, but shit happens, deal with it)\n\nA lot of people have (rather disturbing) intrusive thoughts as well, they don't act on it either, if no one had control over themselves the world would be even worse than now.

        "8189": "It is an Impulse Control Disorder where the person can not resist urges (not compulsions) to set fires. I guess the difference is that a compulsion is more of a \"if I don't do X a certain amount of times, then Y will happen\" and an impulse is just \"I HAVE TO DO X!!!\" It IS to make the person feel better--to relieve the tension that had been building and building. So it is close to OCD, but not quite the same. It is incredibly hard to explain. I guess the easiest way would be to say that when I start fires, I do NOT see the \"Y will happen\" part. I just want to enjoy the flames and get rid of that nagging feeling of needing to see them.\n\nWhat is pyromania to me? A pain in the freaking ass a lot of the time. I get urges to burn shit at the worst times sometimes...and of course, I have to suppress that urge, which in turn makes it 100x worse because then it just builds to an unmanageable level and I end up doing something stupid (like torching a Dumpster...twice).\n\nOh, boy are there misconceptions about my disorder, a lot of which comes from pure ignorance about it. I am supposedly \"dangerous\". I may be a fire-bug but I am NOT stupid. I hate when people assume that I don't have ANY God-given common sense. I am able to suppress the urges, but only for so long. I have been suppressing them now since January, when I had gotten released from Prison (for Arson ffs) and actually for the entire year of 2019 (that is when I was locked up)...it is now starting to come out again. I am STILL able to control it to a point. If it builds TOO much, that is when I lose control and do something destructive. I prefer to set small fires every now and again to release the tension for a while...or at least some of it.\n\nI hope this helped. I am really a gentle person, and I am somewhat of a hippie in fact. I don't eat red meat all that much (only when I absolutely have to like when my iron is super low--I am severely anemic--or when I don't have an alternative)...and I love all insects and animals.

        "8731": "Kinda. My life has been a bit hectic. Just found out my uncle molested all of my aunts when he was 16, including my mom. And it\u2019s surprising because he\u2019s someone you would never expect to do such a thing. And when I asked my dad about it, he confirmed it and it kinda just hit me like a truck. I felt lied to almost but my dad being incapable to emotionally empathize with me, kept telling me to stop crying and that I was being overdramatic and that I shouldn\u2019t cry because I wasn\u2019t the one that got molested. He got even more mad when I asked him why he was being so mean to me, so I ended up having a panic attack. He screamed at me more telling me I am being sooo overdramatic. We\u2019re fine now. But on top of all of this, I realized my chances in getting into one of my dream law schools is very unlikely because my gpa isn\u2019t high enough- the law school gpa requirement is 3.7 and the max I can get when I finish college is a 3.3. So now I\u2019m here beating myself up over the fact that I screwed myself over, yet conflicted because my gpa dropped when my grandfather died of cancer and I was being emotionally and physically abused by my mother and her husband, so I try to excuse my low gpa because of that (I just moved away from her house). I also possibly have BPD or bipolar but I am unmedicated and I have constant paranoia and fear of abandonment, so I am getting into fights with my boyfriend, who is in the state I just left, because I am worried he will not actually move in with me and the distance between me and him is heart breaking. I wake up with constant headaches because I temporarily live in the common area upstairs in my dads home, so I wake up every day at 6 am to my dad and his fianc\u00e9 talking and making food in the morning, my brothers alarm clock constantly ringing because he doesn\u2019t wake up for highschool, and my step-brothers bright ass iPad shining in my face when he passes by the common area. I brought my dog with me on my move and my dads dogs have no manners nor do they understand boundaries so I am having to constantly keep a shoe in my hand to keep my dads dog away from trying to attack my dog, every day. But other than all this, I\u2019ve surprisingly made deans list the past three semesters (I had a term gpa of 3.8 this semester) and I am really looking forward to fixing my car, finally, and also getting a job and moving out in the next month or so :) oh and financially I\u2019m actually doing great- I invested in crypto and it\u2019s really paying off.

        "8760": "Overall, I'd say I'm doing relatively great! I had a bit of a downward spiral about a month ago, but couldn't find a therapist who specialized in what I needed help with, didn't seem shady, and was available. Only one I could find wasn't available until June. However, thanks to my great support system and various tools I've learned from my first therapist and the internet (things other people with my diagnosed conditions and a condition that I strongly suspect I have have tried) I'm doing a lot better. \n\nI started doing yoga and meditating everyday in March and that's helped a lot. I've also started focusing on my art more since I want to become more established as an artist. A little difficult with a  job and college, but surprisingly manageable. It helps that outside of work and school all I really do is art for the most part.\n\nThe only things that I'm not really happy about are my lack of social life (all of my friends are a 4 hour drive away since I haven't been able to make friends in college because covid happened right in the middle of my college career) and that I'm going to be paid less through the summer semester (I'm in a co-op program so summer I have classes so I'll be working part-time instead of full-time).\n\nBut I'm happy overall. I also just started doing my personal art retreats again which definitely helps. I didn't expect to say this much lol, like I said, I have no social life \ud83d\ude05",

And that's really all I can be doing. \n\nIt doesn't help the discomfort I feel sometimes with still be alone at 20, or the sweet whispered nothings when I play Overwatch and wanna just leave mid game because \"it doesn't matter, nothing really matters\". And it doesn't help the deep loneliness I feel because of isolation, or that it's going to fall off a cliff in the coming weeks as my semester ends and I don't even get on Zoom class anymore. \n\nBut my little morning routine doesn't need to help those things. Like hard stuck, burnt food at the bottom of a pot, I think at this point, the only thing that'll help those deeper issues is a lot of time and soapy water.

I\u2019m worried about my boyfriends workplace becoming even more toxic. \n\nAfter I walked out, he called for a mandatory all staff meeting this week where it looks like he plans to continue what he started with me with the rest of the staff.

        "8890": "As mother's day approaches I'm kinda dealing with birth PTSD, three years later still.\n\nTW birth, medical malpractice, gore\n\n\nThey were *supposed* to give me pitocin in order to allow a slow, controlled dilation inducing labor.\n\nBut the intern forcibly broke my water at 1cm dilation, and my body decided it was go time. My body started pushing and within 45 minutes my baby crowned.\n\nDuring that process, I was feeling all of it. I was begging for pain care, and arguing with the nurse via intercom, and they shut my buzzer off to not have to deal with the \"need first time mom who doesn't even know what real pain is\" (overheard by our adoption agent who pitched a fit and physically dragged a nurse in when she heard it.\n\nMy uterus and cervix were just fucking shredded. I had a catheter in, so my urethra was lacerated too. \n\nMy baby got stuck in the birth canal, and, because I was bleeding internally I began to lose strength, couldn't left my hands let alone push. When I started slurring my speech they gave up on screaming at me to push, and *grabbed my vagina and ripped me open by hand*. No time for an episiotomy. \n\nThey realized the catheter was in and ripped it out.\n\nThen they pulled my baby out, and laid him on me. But I couldn't hold him, so he slipped off me while I mumble-cried for help bc I was fading out. My bf caught him as he fell, and held him while the midwife degloved and went out to get the adoptive parents. \n\nPer my request before the birth, adoptive parents were to cut the cord.\n\nWhen she came back in, she saw I hadn't passed the placenta and was gouging blood. A LOT of blood.\n\nShe reached in, no gloves, and ripped my placenta out. That scene from alien has nothing on the feel of another person's hand inside your uterus, clawing the goo from the walls. \n\nThen she stitched me up. Again, I could feel it all. Stitches up my asshole, patching up the wall between colon and vagina. Stitches across my undercarriage. \n\nThey came back every 15 minutes to check for clots, and I had them so bad. Elbows cringing into my belly to dislodge them and (gloved now) hands reaching in to pull them out. \n\nAfter six hours a new-on-shift nurse offered me a single ibuprofen. I was so grateful I broke down in tears. I needed help to even take it.\n\nI spent the next seven months bedridden, unable to stop bleeding. I couldn't piss or bathe myself, and needed help for everything. \n\nI had a bladder and uterine infection. I was in constant agony, and couldn't even sit upright.\n\nWhen I finally recovered, I discovered I'd popped my stitches somehow. I had full uterine prolapse (cervix outside my body), and a rectocele. I'm still waiting my turn for surgery to fix that. \n\nEvery menses, my body squeezes my uterus down into my asshole, and I have to reach inside my body and move it out of the way to take a shit. Once, it got wedged so tightly that the blood couldn't even come out. \n\nThe adoptive parents claimed they wanted an open adoption, like, put it in their stipulations. And they played the part, right up until my work transferred me close enough to actually have the visitation they were always talking about. Then, they stopped returning calls and texts.\n\nSo, to answer the question, no I'm not ok.",

She then left me with the tasks of 1: packing everything in the house that she didn't take or I didn't need, which means basically everything had to be. 2: Finding a new place, as the rent would be far to high at the old place (of which I had lived at for many years, and was only a block away from my childhood place) to be viable for me to stay, nevermind that she had already given the landlord the notice anyways. And 3: Handling everything else that came with this. All in the span of less then 2 weeks, with zero notice whatsoever. The only reason I managed to move everything was because of a shitton of help from friends and a lot of luck. Its currently all stored at a friend's place in their basement, which isn't a long term solution. I also, subsequently, had quit my job a few weeks beforehand due to there being no money in it due to the pandemic, as well as me hating every moment of it generally. And then, on the last day of this move, my cat that I have had longer then I can actually remember died in my arms in the very early morning at age 17, a cat who had been deteriorating horribly in health ever since everything had begun going downhill to the point he couldn't even properly relief himself in the litter box or go down stairs. I have no idea what happened, and I likely never will. All of this, naturally, while my abusive father and his side of the family breathed down my neck every single day.\n\nIts been a few months, I'm no closer to getting a job, I'm living at a friend's house like a parasite, and I simply just don't give a fucking shit. I can't sleep without melatonin anymore, I cry frequently and often, I can't contact my mother anymore besides email, and I  simply have zero reason to keep living past my two best friends, who aren't really reasons so much as anchors. I find myself more and more tempted every day to simply off myself and end it, because holy fucking shit, fuck this.",

I do the home work, i clean, cook, take care of 2 cats and of course i take care of my grandma. Last week i went to see a therapist but i don't know if she will be of much help but i Hope so. I suffered a lot from depression and anxiety for the past 7 years(i'm 24 right now) and i had psicotic breakdowns from which i never really recovered, the scar It left on me is so vivid. I'm trying to get better, i Wish i could be the old me again, the One Who had the courage and passion in everything he did. I had everything and because of my mental healt i Lost It all, i had a wonderful girl and i pushed her away from me, i had the best future i could Imagine, if It wasn't for this illness. I believe that what i have Is affective schizophrenia, that's also my father's illness, and even if i need meds to even get 0.1% better i would take It with lot of Joy. I'm hoping that everything Will work out the best this time, that i'll get better, i tried so much to be high functional, i even lived in another country where i built an incredibile Life but then i had to come back home.. it's been so long since i felt deep emotions except for anger and sadness, i'm longing so much to feel the warmth of relationships again, to feel the connection between me and the world, between me and the people around me.

        "9003": "So, they say that young people may experience a quarter-life crisis. I'll tell you about mine.\n\nIn 2013, when I was 25/26, I had just graduated from Columbia with my Masters. So many of my peers already had so much more work experience and got great job offers. I tried to stay in NY but ended up going back home to CA bc I couldn't afford to stay. Within months of graduating, my dad almost died (complications of diabetes) and he and I moved in with my grandmother so we could care for him. I entered a deep depression. I thought I'd never find a job and would have to care for my father the rest of his life. Seeing the man who raised me look so frail and fall into a deep depression himself was devastating to say the least. I was crying nearly every day and stopped taking care of myself.\n\nEventually, I started to pull myself out of it with some help from a grad school friend. It took me months to finally get a job and then nearly a year to finally get a job somewhat related to my degree. 7 years after graduating and I'm near getting my professional license. And I live in an amazing apartment with a great boyfriend.\n\nTrust me when I say: your time will come. The WORST thing you can do is compare yourself with others. I'd recommend a social media detox. For one thing, people only broadcast the best part of their lives...rarely do people share their struggles. Another thing is, if you spend less time looking at how others live you can focus on how you live.\n\nTake care.",

Work hard to get the job you want is the best advice I can give.",
        "9006": "Honestly, I feel inadequate when I compare myself to anyone but my past self. Don't compare yourself to others for any other reason than to learn and too grow. Don't base your self worth on the comparison of yourself to others, because the reality is that you'll never be any worse, in just the same way you'll never be any better. You wouldn't judge a tomato based on it's comparison to an apple, would you? Sure, they're both round and both red, but that's about where the similarities end.",

You only see what they hand picked for you to see. And I don\u2019t mean to say this as if your weak or not as good at hiding struggle I just say this because when you wake up and you mean to be productive and you aren\u2019t, everyone deals with this many days in a row and you aren\u2019t alone and you aren\u2019t broke. Or lazy or anything and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re envied by someone and have no idea. Just like you envy people and they have no idea",

The first step is always the hardest.\n\nThis year\u2019s pandemic pretty much has killed my business, one that took over 6 years to build and I use to live abroad.

Although I\u2019m neither a senior nor close to graduating (currently a sophomore in undergrad) I\u2019ve experienced something similar. I also have bad anxiety and it can be a consistent issue, making me doubt myself and doubt my future. Recently I hit a deep, dark hole and couldn\u2019t get away from my own feelings telling me I wasn\u2019t good enough, that even with my own goals and motivations I wasn\u2019t going to get anywhere. What got me out of this hole is what other commenters have also said, try to look at your past self. It might be hard at first, but there are things you can look at and identify growth. You\u2019re on track to graduate in December! College is difficult, and graduating with a degree is definitely a step in the direction of success. Try to remember that, when you feel inadequate.

Have you tried speaking to any of these people about how you're feeling? you might get some much needed insight! Also, social media exacerbates this. everyone is posting about all their achievements, all the things they have and all the tings they are doing. what you don't see is that them and their partner are fighting everyday, the car that they post endless photos of  is on finance that they can barely afford and there are other stresses they have to go through everyday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe human race is just winging it man! some of us take longer to mature than others!",

Trust me...I\u2019ve been through it all...schizophrenia, addiction, homelessness, rehab after rehab, so many psych wards, loss of a family member, and I know I slow people down at my job but like I said I just have to be grateful....it\u2019s much easier said than done but maybe just try by starting out your day thinking 5 things your grateful for and remember those things throughout the day. You can do it, you\u2019re already in college which is AWESOME and you\u2019re better than you think you are. Also, you got to have good friends to talk to or just have fun with because maybe that\u2019ll help your anxiety, may be hard at first but it\u2019s worth it to just have people to be around. You got this! Much love",
        "9023": "I started uni this week and this feels a bit similar to me. I started a degree in electrical engineering and when seeing all these people in the lecture hall i feel like a kind of kid. I'm amongst the younger ones, most people had a gap year to figure things out, work, mandatory military service etc. and some have even moved out and live in apartments with friends (the concept of dorms doesn't exist here). They all have these mature vibes, and I feel like a kid here. After all, i started right after high school, failed (mandatory) military recruitment, haven't made much of my own money. There are quite a few that are the same age as me, but in person i can't relate to people here (sounds dumb to say this). I think i like chatting a lot more with some of these people in my degree. And of course the whole stress that came after 6 months of staying at home doing not much apart from learning a language. And of course I'm also a procrastinator. I'm already questioning if this degree was the right choice or if i even should go to uni",
        "9024": "Yes. I'm 29 and thanks to another psychotic episode, I've lost my job, my fiance and had to move back home. I'd really like to be as functional as everyone else my age. I feel so far behind.",
        "9025": "Yeh. I feel this way all the time! I feel like shit because of it. Im 28 and feel like most people my age and younger are more advanced than me!

        "9027": "absolutely in every way",
        "9028": "I struggled with procrastination in college too. I barely graduated and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Ended up enlisting in the military, where I learned a lot about myself including what it means to put forth effort, how to persevere when I don\u2019t feel like it, and how to dig deep and really try. Maybe most importantly, I learned what it feels like to truly succeed and excel, and I learned that I am a lot better at things than I used to believe I was (later I also learned that I had been struggling with undiagnosed ADHD my whole life). Newfound insight and inner strength have helped me clarify my goals and focus my behaviors on getting through impulsivity. \n\nMy advice: don\u2019t give up. I was 25 before I figured out that I wasn\u2019t where I wanted to be, that I had a dream job, and that I actually believed I could succeed at that dream job (and the work it took to get it). Maybe talk to a therapist too.",
        "9029": "There are so many of us. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re the ones that aren\u2019t as noticeable to us, we\u2019re paying more attention to the ones that seem ahead of us in life.",
        "9030": "I have felt the same way. Know that you're not alone and that there is support out there. Everyone is on their own journey in life.",
        "9031": "I was 10 years behind everyone else.  Took me a while to grow into myself I guess.  It's gotten much better as I have gotten older.  procrastination and perfectionism are anxiety coping skills - pretty bad ones because they foster avoidance.  I've worked through that in therapy and it's gotten way better.  Not 100 percent yet, but far far far better.  Needed a guide to get me through it.",
        "9032": "It\u2019s ok to struggle with this but I would try to find a healthy habit like exercising that will help increase your own confidence and make you feel like every day is being accomplished. If you can, switch up the people who are around you to those that encourage said habits. I am going through something similar at 31 years old and my little brother got me into exercising and eating healthy. It has changed my life and the way I look at myself and how I perceive other people\u2019s perception of me. We all have something to contribute to society you will find yours because I know I will find mine! It\u2019s not easy trying but don\u2019t give up!",
        "9033": "Oh man, you are not alone in this. Some of the people I was in high school and college with are amazingly successful. One of my best friends in high school works in astronautical engineering, and kicks it with famous astronauts. My best friend from college has several bachelor degrees and a masters. And then there is me, who wasn't able to get my bachelor's degree because undiagnosed bipolar screwed up my grades and my life, and I eventually ran out of aid/loans. They literally won't give me anymore loans because of how many times I have had to do a medical withdrawal.\n\nThe longest I have held any job is 2 years. My little brother used to be the \"problem child\" who always got in trouble and didn't try in school. I graduated in the top 10 percent of my class through hard work. But now he is a successful chef, and I am the problem child at 31. It is hard not to be jealous and think your life pales in comparison to others.\n\nAll I can say is, it is an unrealistic expectation of yourself. You hear about those physically disabled people who teach themselves to paint with their feet, etc. They get recognition for learning to work around their disabilities because people can SEE AND UNDERSTAND them. Mental illness is still fighting stigma and misunderstanding. So people like you and me who fight to accomplish things other people find simple, don't get the same understanding. \n\nIt is okay to not have as many recognizable accomplishments as your peers. Life, despite the American culture(don't know if you are in USA), does not have to be a competition all the time. It is okay to look at what you HAVE accomplished and feel good about it. And sometimes, just being healthy is a win. Because it takes effort!! Don't sell yourself short.\n\nAlso, some mental illnesses come with mitigating \"superpowers\". I have Bipolar 1, which is often linked to creative genius. Now, I am no creative genius, but I am an artist, and I'm decent enough. And when I succumb to mania or hypomania, I usually produce some of my best work. \n\nSo, instead of looking at your life and successes in comparison to your peers, look at what you can do because of the life you have lived and the struggles you have gone through. Look at your struggles like Mt Everest, just getting through is an accomplishment. Try to give yourself some grace.\n\nBut yes, you are not alone in this feeling, and it is harder some days than others.",
        "9034": "Don't worry about it. Fix yourself then it'll come to you.\n\nIve known lots of people who didn't know what to do, now their up to loads of passionate stuff, I've known people who had dreams and ended up nowhere. It's about how you look after yourself.\n\nMost of the people around you right now will completely change their minds or have life get in the way. Shit happens.\n\nLife comes and goes.\n\nDont worry about it. Work on yourself.",
        "9035": "Try to get out of the rut of comparing yourself to others. I do that a lot and it is terrible. I am trying to break the habit of thinking like that.",
        "9036": "I have heard people say try not to measure yourself against other people. Don\u2019t think so much about what other people are doing think about yourself. Easier said than done but it does help when you can do it.\n\nWhat helps me sometimes is if I can have things to look forward to even if they are small things. Going to the park for a walk going wherever watching a good programme on tv. It might help you have things to look forward to.",
        "9037": "I do to. Im 23 years old graduated uni a year ago. I have a great job that is pretty high paying for a fresh grad compare to other local companies in my country. But I still feel inadequate looking at my friends who have started their own businesses. Granted they are also starters but I feel like I am not working towards my goal of being an owner of a big company. I got the job easily because I was able to impress the higher ups when I was interning so the field maybe similar but its not what I want to do for the rest of my life. And I fear that I might feel too comfortable with a 9-5 job that pays nice and end up not taking risk and chasing after my dream. \n\nFor me my feeling of inadequate cam from my parents saying I have so much potential for greatness, which in return started to have extremely high expectations for myself. I have a whole timeline planned on what I should achieve by which age and I get anxious and worry that I would not be able to meet my own high expectations.",
        "9038": "I feel the same tbh",
        "9039": "ALL THE TIME. I work almost full-time at a grocery store in my home town and every time any of my old high school classmates come in, all I can think of is how much better they're doing than me and how I've done nothing in the four and a half years since I graduated. I try to remind myself that I just haven't had the chance to take the opportunities I need yet, but when the comparison is right in front of you, it doesn't always help.",
        "9040": "I feel the same exact way, I've been struggling with these feelings for a long time. I am so sorry you're going through this as well, but, boy is it a relief to hear that it's not an uncommon feeling to have. I've always gravitated more towards people who are in an older age bracket than myself anyway but as I've gotten older, 25-30 is an age group in itself and I just feel soo incredibly behind on everything. I'm new to tech, I'm new to socializing, I'm new to everything. It feels like I'm in my twenties equipped for high school (barely) but nothing further.",
        "9041": "Please don't take this the wrong way, but I laughed when I read your post. I know  e x a c t l y how you feel. I was in the same spot 2 years ago. I graduated in December and I was absolutely terrified. I also had major anxiety that had been totally exacerbated in this newfound \"adulthood\". Suddenly you turn a certain age and the world expects you to just be an adult after only being a student, it's comical. \n\nLet me tell you something, all those people who look like they've got it all figured out... absolutely do not. No one does. That's the problem with being a career student for approximately 16 years. I was one of those people who looked like they had it all together, which is so hilarious to type out because I never ever once thought that about myself. But people would tell me that. The thing is, I was living day by day just like everyone else. Second guessing every single choice I made. There's a good chance you have it more together than you think, go easier on yourself. \n\nCollege sucks the life out of you. I can tell you my life got exponentially better when I graduated because I finally had time to do things other than stress about the looming assignments, exams, overall student lifestyle that I hated so much. I get to develop as a real human now and it feels so good. I get to go to therapy more consistently and take care of myself. I can be a functional adult. I get to see my friends and family, I'm taking tennis lessons and I get to ride my horse that I never got to ride in college. \n\nThe best advice I can give you is this: Don't let the next 3 months stress you out to the point that it takes away your quality of life. Just finish your classes as strong as you can. \n\nHere's some professional advice if you want it: 1. If your school has a career center and you have free time maybe go down there and see what resources are available. The reason I got a job at Goldman Sachs is because of my career center.  2. If you want to pad your resume a bit maybe look around for internships to apply to, either this semester or for when you graduate. They always look super good on any resume, even if it's not exactly in your field. 3. Get friendly with your professors or other similar mentors, or academic advisors. Even in online classes I just got super in their faces with emails, on phone calls, and appointments to make it look like I really really was trying and then I did try haha. This is important for letters of rec which are absolutely priceless, they're not hard to get as long as they know you. \n\nI know that sounds like a lot but honestly those three things are super simple and don't take a ton of effort. The funny thing about college is I did those three things and got the same job as all the kids that were running around like crazy getting cutthroat finance degrees working their asses off, but instead I got a humanities degree and had a pretty easy time in college studying what I genuinely enjoyed and all I had to do was spend a few minutes each week emailing my professors and hacking the game a little bit? Amazing. College is a scam, you will be totally okay! \n\nSorry for going crazy on the college/career advice and less on the mental health advice but if you do want career advice in the future feel free to dm me!",

It\u2019s okay to live and grow at your own pace regardless of societal expectations.

I've recently been feeling a lot like that, and I've been reminding myself of this. If you have debilitating anxiety, see a psychiatrist. I recently started muting instagram stories of people whose posts constantly me feel bad about myself",
        "9050": "So I am 46 and working in a field I love, married, with a child and own my own business. I still feel like others are much more mature than me. I think back to my aunties at my age and they looked like adults and they all were housewives. I remember the panic when I graduated at 22. What do I do now? I was told go to college and you get a good job. It wasn\u2019t there and the bar had been placed higher. I feel like after spending 16 years in school, where your job is school, it is scary to know what to do next. I fumbled around traveled some and ended up working in the addiction field. I love it and I know I make a difference but when someone asks me about it it seems like I have done nothing even though they are impressed. I have figured out it is not about what others think but only if I give myself credit for what I have achieved and that is hard for me. I don\u2019t think I will ever feel like an adult bc that is some imaginary thing I made up as a kid. Everyone else is just better at pretending to be grown then I am. The good news is I laugh way more than other people my age. I don\u2019t take anything to seriously bc that does not make an adult it just makes me miserable. Also studies say the more intelligent you are the more likely you are to say that you are not an expert at something and know there is always more to learn. You are not alone and hopefully you will take the opportunities that come your way or make some of your own. Each one really does give you something to use even if it is not the perfect job.",

If you haven't found out what you're passionate about, keep looking! Here's the thing, people love watching passionate people do their thing! Whether it's streaming games, or singing, or whatever! Do something you want to do in life! Follow your passion! Follow your heart!

Every time we do something or think in a certain\nway it carves a path in our brain for it. The more we do that, the deeper that path gets and it becomes a trench. The next time something triggering happens, you\u2019ll go to your \u201cpracticed\u201d response or fall in the tench.\n\nHaving been where you are right now, I still get the thought but I recognise that I\u2019m thinking that way; acknowledge it and then choose to do something completely different to try and create a new path/trench. It\u2019s definitely working but very hard, it requires patience, exposure to triggering events and the presence of mind to see what you\u2019re doing and the strength to choose to do something different. Therapy is great because you have someone who can support you while you learn to do that and help out with it.\n\nHope that helps, sending you love.",

This leads to emotional reactions that can be dramatically out of proportion to minor positive or negative events. Other ways it often presents are very rapid transitions back and forth between intensely positive and intensely negative emotions and love/hate relationships with other people.

I can tell you what I've learned and you can see whether it sounds similar to your experience.\n\nAccording to the DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) theory of BPD, it's caused by someone who is biologically predisposed to feeling emotions more strongly and for longer than most people being raised in an environment where they don't learn how to regulate their emotions effectively. As a result, people with BPD are predisposed to a \"cycle of catastrophe\" where they feel an intense negative emotion and need to address it externally, so they make a decision that will help them feel differently in the short term like bingeing, overspending, using drugs or alcohol, cutting people off, substituting a different emotion like anger, etc despite it leading to longer term problems, which are then responded to the same way, perpetuating the cycle. So for example in the case you mentioned, the BPD psychology would be skipping plans because of feeling depressed, which would lead to emotions like guilt or shame because you feel like you're letting those friends down, which would be responded to by avoiding them, which creates negative emotions due to not having social support, etc.",

        "9162": "Yup, my ex-wife went though the same thing. Diagnoses of depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD... once a therapist (MY therapist actually, from hearing about it from my perspective) suggested BPD and we both started reading about it, holy shit did a lot of things click.",

I just talk about how I feel about my mum doing abusive stuff. But that's it rlly. It's just me complaining and her nodding and saying 'oh yeah I understand that would make you feel invalidated'. It just feels like talking to a friend, which IS nice, but doesn't help at all. I'm still crying everyday and waking up feeling like shit every morning",

        "9172": "Please look for a new therapist, it sounds like she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about honestly and she\u2019s not a good fit for you. If she\u2019s not helping your situation and improving your mental health, she\u2019s not exactly a good therapist for you",

        "9175": "Precipitation is changeable, especially on lsd. What happens while on lsd is the neurons in your brain deattach and reattach to different neurons that they originally were not connected too. As voxs explained put it, it\u2019s like when you\u2019re going down a snowy hill on a sled, as you continue to use it, one path usually become the main path. Lsd/shrooms is like a new snow coming down that allows you to take new paths down the hill. Most likely, at first you will have these original feelings, but if you meditate or try hard to think \u201cwhat I\u2019m saying isn\u2019t true, it\u2019s never/very rarely been true in the past with other things I\u2019ve convinced myself of, and this will help me with my problems like it has for many people in the past\u201d, it will change your mood and perception of the trip. Obviously I know this is harder to believe especially when your mind won\u2019t allow you to think differently, but I\u2019d assume with how lsd works it might be easier to say this and believe it. Also I still believe trying a microdose would be your best bet as you have no real change in visuals, and it\u2019s not like an actual trip at all. It usually just makes you more creative and you start to view things differently. \n\nOnce on weed I have a view flip (like my view just really quick reserved itself and went back to normal) and that fucked me up for a good 30 minutes to and hour trying to convince myself everything was find and how I was feeling was good.",

You could have just dismissed my opinion. \n\nAlso...Islam. \n\nI learned what I know underneath the city of Las Vegas.

I don't know where you live, but do you have the option of socialized insurance or government-subsidized treatment programs? Another possibility if you're somewhere developed might be a sliding-scale clinic or a non-profit social services group.",
        "9185": "If your therapist isn't taking you seriously and the program isn't helping you, then it's not worth it. Try talking to them about it again and insist that you feel the way you feel and you need to be taken seriously.",
        "9186": "Mainly vertigo. I get it when I'm really anxious and don't feel safe but on Citalopram I had it all the time! I couldn't walk very fast without needing to sit down.\nI get hallucinations from the Prozac but it's nothing serious. I'll often see spiders run across the floor that aren't really there. I've never really had a problem with spiders so it's odd.",
        "9187": "That is a very understandable. Psychedelics aren\u2019t for everyone an anyone who\u2019s ever tried them would know that, if you think something really bad would happen from it than you shouldn\u2019t take it so. \n\n\nThis was a really nice conversation though, I enjoy talking about delics with people",
        "9188": "Again, right there with ya but at the same time even when a person has depression if there\u2019s something that really excites them and consumes their mind they will draw the motivation. So maybe even though in your mind you really need a solution but none are convenient enough try smaller steps. And you can even make it something you enjoy. Excercise was just a two birds one stone type of idea",
        "9189": "I live in England. I'm getting free therapy, I had to wait 6 months for a therapist. Therapy doesn't help at all, I keep getting worse. \n\nAlso during therapy I seem really normal and put together, she has nooo idea how bad this gets. Even when I describe things to her I don't think she understands how bad it is.",

She would tell me to stop acting like a child and get over it. It didn't help that this girl was also a narcissist. Never disclose any of your weaknesses to a narc.

        "9202": "I have been helping people with mental health problems for decades and really dedicated my whole life to it. However, there's a lot of \"wtf\" about mental health problems. \n\nI used to have a client, back in like 1996, who kept his poop in milk cartons in the fridge because he thought it was magical. I can't get it out of my head. \n\nI have talked about this, used it as examples, joked about it, and it's just because it's so strange it's hard to process and let go of. \n\nI have a female friend of mine who I think it the smartest and funniest woman I have ever met. However, she \"likes\" being addicted to drugs. She has been raped countless times, and once she passed out in a trap house and woke up to being gangraped, and asked the guys for money, according to her. She is also a street prostitute in this horrible part of town called Kensington in Philly. \n\nShe grew up with bikers in her family than had her on drugs by 8 years old, and \"sold\" her for other things. I know her mom that was part of it and so forth. So, I get she has massive trauma an is the product of that. \n\nHowever, she is smart, gives excellent advice, is philosophical, and can keep up with me in a discussion which I respect greatly. However, all the stuff I just mentioned plays on my mind when I speaking to her sometimes. I'm like, I love this person and admire her----but maybe she's crazy!! \n\nThat's an extreme example, but I'm used to extreme situations. Most people are not and so when they know you have a mental health problem, it's like saying you're radioactive, and they can't stop thinking about it. \n\nThat's why you should keep stuff like that private or only tell people you absolutely believe in.",

It\u2019s 2020 for fuck sakes, therapy is not something to whisper, psychiatry is medicine, the people who refuse to accept these facts are 10/10 times your usual insecure individual trying to live under societal expectations.. so they project their social insecurity in other people. \n\nI remember just how devastated I was when I came to the realization that I was mentally ill, I thought I suddenly found out I was subhuman, that other people were somehow better because everyone would treat me like shit then. \n\nA lot of problems we think we have in life are nothing but the problem of somebody else who decides to make it *our problem* because they take no accountability.",

Diagnosed by a doctor with sleep studies. \nPeople that have no clue have actually tried to tell me that it's all in my head, that changing my diet / exercise routine would cure it.\nSome act like it's an excuse, that I'm just lazy & worthless.\nAfter being diagnosed & put on stimulant meds so that I can function fairly typically, I am treated as a drug seeker or a meth head / speed freak by some. Despite the fact that I have taken meds exactly as prescribed for over 10 years, never even tried street speed, and have to pass drug screens on a regular basis.\nAlso, however, with stimulants, I am not \"speedy\" at all. I am often still tired, still require naps at times. The meds just enable me to not have to take 7+ naps a day. \nI am far from lazy. Before I had any issues with narcolepsy I was an A-B student, kept up with many activities, my social circle, projects, etc...I have always been a hard worker.\nWhen I was first experiencing narcolepsy symptoms and didn't know what was going on, it was the lowest point of my life. I suddenly couldn't seem to stay awake for anything, no matter how important to me or anyone else. I literally hated myself and still feel a lot of traumatic shockwaves from that period. I absolutely did feel worthless and I hated that, but I was powerless to change it all on my own. I still feel guilt and worry about how I may have let others down during that period.\nNow that I function fairly typically, sometimes when I accomplish something big that I worked hard on and I am proud of, it is dismissed as, \"well, yeah, I could do that if I were taking speed every day, too.\"\nVery hurtful.\nIt's often referred to as a silent disease, and it seems many regard it as not being real because of that.\nIt's okay, though.

(The two are not mutually exclusive.) At the same time, I wish they had more empathy for me.\n\nAlthough I'm not as insightful as I would like to be, I have noticed that people who are venting do not like to be told they're wrong.

        "9267": "Man good news!\n\nI just want to say one thing that has opened my eyes a lot, and may be interesting.\n\nFirstly, as intelligent, self-aware beings, it only makes sense to me that suicide should be a natural choice.  It appears to me that our right to death is as important, if not even more so, than our right to life.  I think in almost all cases, the decision to die is often made hastily and out of temporary emotional distress, and is (as you point out here) most likely a mistake.\n\nI say this just because I think the subject should be approached differently than it is in society today.  It is not wrong to kill yourself, but it is also not any better than just simply being.  I think it is something I may have heard from Alan Watts in his lectures on zen that the spirit world/ death just isn't viewed as any different from life.  Anyway, the last thing I want to say leads on from this which is that living in the present moment is a retreat.  Practising mindfulness, breathing, is something that has been revolutionary to me.  It really helps gain a third-person perspective on your life and realise that your emotions are just emotions - they guide you, but they *are not* you.  Listening to guys like Thich Naht Hanh on his monestary's youtube channel Plum Village has been really useful for me this past year.\n\nPersonally I got off antidepressants around a year ago because they seemed to make it worse, and being more mindful and physically active seemed to work for me, but if that's what works for you then keep it up.  Just know there are more options, and more routes to health.  Life's an ongoing, individual experience.  Your psychiatrist doesn't have all the answers either, only their own.  It took me a while to realise the best solution for me was to leave (medicated) psychiatry, it just wasn't an effective tool.",

If a woman goes through a difficult break up with a man and publicly (on social media, where else) calls him out for being abusive (which nowadays refers to a very wide umbrella of behavior which they deem toxic or problematic) the man must not be defended or allowed to provide his own context. He is trash, never to be defended, never to be trusted again by anyone. \n\nBecause he is a man, he must be the culprit and the woman his victim.

I think the criteria also had a change relatively recently between the dsm 4 & 5, not 100% on that. You should read Girl, Interrupted if you haven't it has characters that are clearly correctly dxed with it and others that are probably not like the author Susanna Kaysen. It takes place in the 1960s.\n\nAlso, since your psych feels that way, you can ask her to change your dx to a trauma disorder NOS since CPTSD doesnt exist in the dsm yet if you want.\n\n What I was worried about and still worry about for others is that a BPD dx is subject to a lot of stigma and discrimination from healthcare professionals in general. Honestly I've had doctors be dismissive about totally unrelated conditions because of my mental health conditions that they knew about and BPD wasn't one of them. I have been in the ER with an injury and acute PTSD from that accident and my injuries went untreated because they didn't believe me. I had to go back when I was more mentally sound and basically go off on them for that.

One medication may alleviate symptoms of depression for Person A yet it may make depression symptoms worse for Person B.  Second, that anti-depressants are supposed to make you feel numb or emotionless.  Feeling numb or emotionless means something is wrong.  If the medication is working properly for you, you will no longer be depressed and you will feel positive emotions strongly.  If you feel numb and depressed while taking anti-depressants you must tell your doctor.\n\nIn July of 2018, I started Zoloft.  Within a few weeks I was pulled out of my severe depression and I was feeling REALLY well everyday.  Not even manic, just really well and depression-free every single day for the first time in my 25 year life.  I was numb before I started the medication and within weeks I could feel again.  I woke up crying, elated because the war I had been fighting for 25 years finally was over.",

Unlike anxiety or depression (which i also have) you can sort if white knuckle it and come out the otherside and work on it but an ED is a constant creeping.\n\nAnd not all EDs look skeletal. I swing back and forth between anorexia, bulimia and binge eating. Im overweight because whenever i diet i takenit way too far. What starts as a perfectly normal diet turns into beating myself up for not having a smaller number on the scale than yesterday. Its loosing 70lbs and not being able to see that ive lost that weight so pushing it further. And once you get to that point 9ne of two things happen. You get stuck, or like me the pendulum goes back and i binge all that weight and more back on. \n\nMy eating disorder didnt come from control, it came from everyone telling me i was fat when i actually wasnt. I was a size 12. But i was told i was fat so much that i started dieting and still being called fat and that pendulum swing was only small at first. But enough to loose a stone in two days and slowly put it back on in the next 5. And this was highschool.\n\nI had family members telling me that i needed to split a 400 calorie sandwich into two meals. That i didnt need two pieces of toast. And so i fell into thier habit of eating one meal a day and surprisingly still being \"fat\" \n\nNow i actually am fat and that sick part of my brain longs to look like OP before treatment. To be so not fat that i can dissapear. So that people dont shout things at me in the street or avoid me on public transport... and yeah im big but im not 600lb life big... and thats the sad thing.",
        "9799": "I had an eating disorder ages 18-21 maybe 22, and I wish I would have just learned that it IS all calories in calories out, plus water weight fluctuations. If I had accepted that as the fact that it is, I could have safely lost the 10-15 pounds I wanted to lose. Instead, I starved myself completely for 3 days or so, then if I magically wasn\u2019t lots of weight lower, I would binge, back and forth, until I was quite underweight but not trusting that I could eat a regular diet without ballooning up in weight. \n\nYour comment about losing 14 pounds in two days reminds me of that mindset because it is thoroughly impossible, that\u2019s only water weight. Otherwise you\u2019d have to burn/starve 49,000 calories in two days which is impossible. But our brains see that number on the scale and forget all else. I just wish they taught more about food and how calories work in school so some of us wouldn\u2019t have been so afraid.",
        "9800": "See there are a lot of factors that can infouence those fluctuations but because all thats pushed is numbers its hard to not focus on that. Instead of being a number or trying to reach a certain number i wish they focused on overall health. The quality of food, the quality of sleep and regularity of moderate exercise. \n\nMy issues stem right from birth. It was never about anxiety or control for me. It was neglect that instilled that need to eat now because later was never guarrunteed. Then it was simply poverty and a caregivers own disordered eating being pushed onto me. Im 29, and i was only diagnosed last year by chance because the therapist i was talking to mentioned getting refferal (which the GP was somewhat trying to discourage me from) \n\nIve never in my life been able to respond to my own hunger cues. Along with other basic cues like tiredness or the toilet. The binge is fuelled by restriction and that innate ingrained need to seek and eat. To hoard food for later. But the message has always been that im too big, which i wasnt. But now i am and im struggling to loose weight in a healthy manner. Its a slippery slope from just managing a \"normal\" diet, to skipping meals entirely or purging because its always pushed that if i just try harder, i wont be fat anymore. And ergo if im not fat anymore im not disgusting, useless, lazy ect anymore.\n\nBut the fact is, my needs were never a priority and as such i never learned to recognise them.\n\nRight now, im personally practicing to not say no to myself but to also actually listen to the cues. So if i want chocolate, i can have it, but i dont have to eat the whole packet. I dont have to clean my plate nor do i have to eat before im actually hungry. I will still cook the meal for the household but set mine aside and reheat it when i actually want it. Which also in turn helps me to not binge because the meal is already prepared when im not hungry as aposed to cooking once i am.\n\nIts a weird muddle of things that still culminates in the same fucked up behaviour as I and the others in my therapy group at the time came to realise.\n\n(And i now realise i repeated a lot of what you replied to...)",

I give myself permission to walk to the sink, start the timer, and go. \n\nAt the 20 minute mark, I am allowed to walk away if I just can't manage any more. However, 90% of the time, I have got into a groove and am happy to just continue on and get the job done.\n\nWeirdly, looking at a chore in my mind while I procrastinate and think of all the reasons I don't want to do it is almost always far worse than the actual chore itself.\n\nI don't ever say, \"you are going to go into the kitchen and do all of the dishes, mop the floor, clean the benches, and put out the trash\". It's too much and I find it I try to take that on I shut down. \n\nWith this 20 minute thing, it feels more manageable and gets me started. Usually that's all it takes. If I don't manage to complete everything usually another go the next day will get me through.\n\n_\n\nWhen I was at my worst, I started a gym routine. Some days I could barely get out of bed.\n\nSo instead of telling myself \"you're going to the gym\" (instant overload and shutdown), I would say \"just roll out of bed and put on clothes\".\n\nUsually I could manage that much.  Throwing in a tee shirt, shorts, shoes is not rocket science, right? \n\nSo then I would say to myself \"just pack a bag\". Still, I wouldn't think any more steps ahead, or it would all look too hard, and I would end up back in bed.\n\nNext was, grab the keys and get to the car.\n\nOnce I was in the car, usually it was enough to be able to turn the ignition and let muscle memory take over. The rest took care of itself. \n\nThis method helped me a lot on days when doing anything felt impossible. I managed to start, and stick to the routine. I still go 3 - 4 times a week. \n\nSome days I still feel shitty, but just do the same thing, but with larger steps. \"Just get yourself there and walk in\". I never tell myself \"you have to do a full gym workout with 100% effort and every single stretch and rep\" because that would feel like overload on bad days. Simply getting myself there (starting the ball rolling, if you like) is almost always enough.\n\nAnd I allow myself a treat when I complete a workout. Nothing fancy, just some kind of food I really like and don't normally eat at home. Rewards are always good as long as you don't overdo it.\n\nLittle steps. Don't break off more than you can chew. Be gentle with yourself. Forgive yourself if you can't do a thing. Sometimes it's enough just to do what you can manage on the day. Some of the task is always better than none of the task.\n\nGood luck",

        "9969": "I kind of wish I could have had a proper diagnosis in school. I just got ADD. I believe it was an accurate diagnosis. It was not overly diagnosed back then and I genuinely suffered in school due to difficulties focusing, spacing out etc and the subsequent mistreatment by certain teachers. \n\nI also believe strongly that I also had at least some form of anxiety disorder. I started feeling terrified of going to school in 2nd grade. I still remember the dread to this day. I would SCREAM and cry. I saw counselors at school for that. They were convinced I was simply \"clinging to mommy\" which is crap, looking back. I was fine, loved school, and then I wasn't. What happened in my brain? \n\nTo put it simply this feeling continued through high-school. It manifested differently. I still cried a lot. I started feeling trapped in my body. Trapped alive. I felt dread, terror, emptiness and lots of loneliness. But I was older then and I didn't choose ask for help. I just skipped a lot of school. I got really good at it and coasted through on good test grades and projects etc. Although I almost got kicked out a couple times for truancy. \n\nSuicidal ideation started somewhere around 13 but I would tell myself I just needed to experience a few more things in life and then I could leave consciousness. I held a blade to my wrist for the first time at 16. Subsequently at around 18, and then again at 25. I did not tell anyone. I was able to talk myself down each time to stay for my family. To experience just a little more before I leave.\n\nThe last time, 12 years ago at 25 I made a promise to myself...Kind of like a pact I guess. If I didn't do it then I wasn't ever going to try again. I knew what I was choosing and I chose life, no matter what. If I was going to do it later I might as well have done it right then. \n\nI went on a \"growth journey.\" I worked to see the value in being alive, even through the feelings in my body thoughts in my head. I coped very well for years. \n\nAnd i'm losing my handle on it right now. I'm trying to approach it differently this time. I'm trying to talk about it as much as I can. I'm telling anyone who's genuinely interested in how i'm feeling. I reached out to a doctor. \nI think i'll be ok but it's so challenging right now to wait to hear from the psychologist.\n\nI'm finding it hard to focus on anything but my health. I don't want to paint, draw, read, watch tv. And yet I can stare at one spot on my wall for an hour. \nI try to do my physio exercises and find myself either crying or spaced out and not knowing for how long. \nI feel grief. It's hard to sleep. I wake up feeling hollow and panicked. My brain and spine are vibrating a lot and I feel dizzy more often than not. I feel restless and constantly driven and yet so fatigued and slow. I want to do everything but I feel like doing nothing. I feel like i'm moving through water. It feels difficult to face another day. Writing about it helps a little...",

        "9978": "Good for you for reaching out!\nHopefully when you are paired with a psychiatrist you feel comfortable with them, but I would also highly suggest a therapist as well. The best places are the ones where the psychiatrist and the therapist work in the same building. They have access to one another\u2019s notes and it promotes optimal care. \nI suggest a therapist in addition to a psychiatrist though because generally psychiatrists are a bit quirky. They\u2019re not REALLY trained to talk with you like a therapist is. \nWhen I received my most jarring diagnosis and I tried to ask the psychiatrist about it he only said this is just to help us treat you better. Which is all fine and dandy but I needed to talk about it. My therapists at the time were only grad students and because I was not presenting like the textbook version of that diagnosis they were very invalidating ...\n\nWhile you wait for appointments look for support groups in your area. The one I\u2019m in is meeting virtually which was really nice to have my first meeting that way because I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder so meeting for the first time online was a little easier than driving to the spot and meeting everyone face to face. \n\nAnother suggestion is looking up mental health hotlines for your area. There\u2019s the general suicide hotline and such but there are those that exist locally. I\u2019ve had to call a couple times and I find those a little more helpful. \n\nMy final suggest for you is a DBT skill called opposite action, because you said you\u2019re finding it hard to motivate yourself to do the things you know you enjoy. The skill is exactly what it sounds like. For me I\u2019m trying to pick up my sketchbook again. I bought a new one and a couple new pencils but I haven\u2019t drawn in it yet. I want to but there\u2019s that barrier there and opposite action is all about (these are my words) saying fuck you to that barrier and drawing anyway. Even if it sucks. Even if it\u2019s not your best just do it. Use opposite action to do those little things that make you happy, even if you can\u2019t quite feel that satisfaction yet, just keep pushing against that barrier. \n\nI hope all that helped a little! It sounds like you\u2019ve been doing really well, and that you\u2019re strong willed in fighting your mind. There\u2019s nothing wrong with needing a bit more help at times. We all fall down, even those without mental illnesses do, we just have to keep going and keep advocating for ourselves.",

There are certain predisposed people who can experience psychosis as a result of smoking too much for a certain period of time. \nI think those with the predisposition generally have underlying mental health conditions but that\u2019s just my guess. \n\nI agree it should be federally legalized but I just want to warn others because I don\u2019t want others to experience what I went through.

He\u2019s cut himself off from his friends, doesn\u2019t go out (even pre Covid) and seems like he\u2019s just waiting for his time to wind down.

You may experience a bit of shock and a floaty feeling for a bit (YMMV of course) so I want to encourage you to take small, gentle moves today and the next couple of days. Wrap yourself in warm blankets. This may be the sign you need, but it\u2019s also a sign that you are in deep need of compassion and care *right now* too. Is there someone in your life you trust to ask to come sit quietly with you? And fuck COVID or I would offer to come sit there myself.

Im not even suggesting the psych ward has to be where you stay. Maybe being alone with thoughts and feelings at the moment led to this?  I know personally it was a big part of my relapse and issues, especially if something upsetting happend. I can't explain in words how peace and acceptance has made a huge improvement in my life, I used to see many Drs, have taken everything from lithium to lamictal trying to fix myself. I have gone from anxious and hurt to a brand new person, mostly from listening to others with mental health issues, and finding ways to relax myself without anything. (Rosicrucian incantation sacred sounds feels like you're floating after 1 time). I know people who seek peace through the right Dr and meds and sometimes  that doesn't work out and only makes you more insane, after 10+ years I realized  a more therapeutic healing was what I needed. I'm not telling you what to do I'm just sharing what has honestly helped me so much, I'm sure others will disagree and that is fine , I say this as someone with heavy a diagnosis and just one or two.

        "10713": "I love this drawing! I\u2019ve been doing similar types of stuff just tryna get it all out of there, and I\u2019ve learned a decent amount on the way - it\u2019s an excellent means for overcoming trauma and other preverbal adverse childhood experiences (that\u2019s why the no words, it\u2019s actually called Alexythymia). We should totally do like an art interpretation thing with these to try and crowdsource will our collective knowledge the right words or descriptions for these! My experience with a bunch of books I read was that like when you come across the rights words describing your inner state you *know*.  \n\nI remember reading Christine Ann Lawson\u2019s book on mothers with BPD (which mine has) where she wrote something about denigration and the deep internalised shame that accompanies it that \u2018takes away a child\u2019s feeling of their right to take up space\u2019 or something and being like \ud83e\udd2f holy shiatsu this is exactly how I feel!!! And it was a massive breakthrough for me. I didn\u2019t know - like I didn\u2019t properly buy into all that stuff you read about being able to say it out loud and then it\u2019s not stuck inside you like it\u2019s an actual part of you anymore - but it\u2019s like that. \n\nOnly it\u2019s better because semantics are crucial to metacognition - thinking about thinking- and, for me, proper reflection (as an adult now) into those feelings was the way out of those crappy yelling voices in my head. Every time I untangled a memory of an experience and chased it back that little bit further by looking at *why* I\u2019d done that \u2018horrible shameful\u2019 thing that I was denigrated for, I realised I\u2019d done it for a damn good reason, so regardless of the method of chastisement, the chastisement wasn\u2019t appropriate in the first place, and every time I did that, I\u2019d get rid of one of those voices up in there. It was an incredibly empowering experience- and it felt *really* good. Like aloe on sunburn. And pretty much ever since I\u2019ve just been trying to find the best way to put it down as a roadmap for anyone else struggling with the same stuff because it was awesome- in the sense of \u2018awe\u2019, which I read somewhere evokes this feeling like \u2018everyone should see this!!!!\u2019 maybe because it\u2019s too big for one person, I dunno. \n\nAnyways I hope maybe I\u2019ve offered up a couple words for you! Don\u2019t stop drawing, like ever, you\u2019re really talented and pictures like these say thousands of words, every one of them the right one \ud83d\ude09",

They also come with a strap so you can wear it around your body like a bag, it\u2019s pretty cute :) sometimes when I wear dresses with no pockets, I will use the strap to keep my phone on me. It\u2019s pretty convenient",

        "11194": "That\u2019s actually really amazing.",
        "11195": "About 6 years ago there was a facility that opened up near me. Its purpose was to take in at-risk people, who were not yet suicidal, to get help. It was kind of like inpatient hospital lite. The staff was well trained and pleasant. You saw a psychiatrist almost daily, had one-on-one therapy, goal planning, some group therapy, art, meal planning, pet therapy, watched movies, and went on walks. We were also allowed time out on the porch as it was not a locked facility. And *gasp* it even allowed people to smoke if they wanted to.\n\nI had stayed there several times and it kept me from getting bad enough to require a hospital stay. Unfortunately, due to poor promotional work, it was not well known to the public, most didn't know of its existence, and it closed after a few years. \n\nThis, in my mind, is the type of care that we desperately need more of.",
        "11196": "In some places suicide is illegal. \n\nIt\u2019s sad that a community would rather rally around someone who commits a petty crime and they have a tear jerker story of how they ended up in the situation. \n\nYOU shouldn\u2019t have to commit a crime just to receive help. \n\nI love you",
        "11197": "Personally have been rejected from therapist for being suicidal. Being suicidal is not taken seriously until you actually end up in the hospital. You could have suicidal thoughts and you can attempt to commit suicide, but it\u2019s not until you\u2019re almost successful when you actually get help.",
        "11198": "Conversation between me and the hospital:\n\nMe: \u201cI want to get admitted.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m diagnosed with PTSD. I haven\u2019t slept in several days. I\u2019m experiencing paranoia and delusions and disorganized thoughts and behavior and am having vivid intrusive thoughts I\u2019m having a hard time telling from reality. I spontaneously quit my job. I keep doing things I don\u2019t remember. My psych and therapist advised me to go the hospital. My family and medical team want me to go to the hospital to keep me safe until I get a change in meds and calm down.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cAre you planning to hurt anyone?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cDo you have a plan to kill yourself?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cNo. I\u2019m in hell but I know it\u2019s temporary. I just can\u2019t trust my behavior and I don\u2019t know how bad this will get.\u201d\n\nThem: \u201cWe can\u2019t take you unless you have an active plan to kill yourself.\u201d\n\nSo finally I realized I had to say yes, I had a plan. And then they asked me to describe the plan in detail. And I had to make up from whole cloth how I was planning to off myself. And it was documented everywhere. I hung up the phone on them and redialed them six times before I could bring myself to lie.\n\nI feel like a recommendation from my psych should have been enough. I\u2019m self aware enough of my mental health issues to know they\u2019re temporary and I shouldn\u2019t act on it, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t severe!",
        "11199": "thats the funny part, ive been suicidal for years and i have barely gotten any help..",
        "11200": "Right. Currently going thru crap with my husband and it's like everyone is far to worried about him. Like I don't exist",
        "11201": "Omg! Right?! I\u2019m dealing with this rn. Even though I am suffering my psych tells me I am doing well. My SI has not gone to making a plan yet..so I\u2019m fine. But my anxiety is killer with the lowness. Blah\u2026says she doesn\u2019t want me in the hospital. What does she expect me to do?",
        "11202": "Amen! I've been saying this for decades. By the time it gets out of control, it's usually too late for intervention.",
        "11203": "it\u2019s not as great as the one you\u2019re talking about, but local to me there is an agency that has crisis stabilization units (open to everyone). they\u2019re a non-inpatient facility but you stay there for around 3-7 days. you see a med provider, have check ins with clinicians each day. sometimes there\u2019s groups. there\u2019s tv and games, an art room. it got boring at times but it\u2019s definitely better than a hospital stay. definitely something that should be more widespread.",
        "11204": "Yes if there was some of these spread around the country (usa) it would defiantly help a lot of people.",
        "11205": "There are shelters like that all over the US and most other western countries but *only* for one demographic with one type of need.\n\nKeeping any other kind of shelter open is all but impossible because nobody's re-election hinges on funding it and it's considered fine to actively oppose it when people try...",
        "11206": "That sounds amazing\u2026 add exercise and take away the smoking, and you\u2019ve really got something. \n\nAdd psychedelics (which help with PTSD and depression) and you\u2019ve really got something more\u2026 but still take away all the smoking\u2026\n\nMust mask and vaccinate\u2026\n\nMust live communally and contribute to either society or at least do chores for the upkeep of the program\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s like a co-operative, or a kibbutz.",
        "11207": "How is suicide illegal? Maybe attempted suicide? Life if you succeed, what they gonna do?",
        "11208": "Yup. My friend tried to commit suicide and instead of going to the hospital, she was in the parish jail for six months and had a whole bunch of fines. This was in louisiana",
        "11209": "hey if you ever need to talk dm me you can rant or we can just talk",
        "11210": "Heard that. I would usually agree that those are reasons for a place like that to close down, but in this case it closed due to a mix of poor advertising/advocating for the place, and its location. It has a sister facility from the same company in a different region, and it has been successful for years. I cant say what it is like there, as I have never been. But if it is anything like the one I was at then its residents are getting quality care that I haven't seen anywhere else. I kind of gush about that place mainly because it was not privately owned and just about anyone from any economic background could get in, as well as a variety of mental health issues and substance abuse issues. The world needs more like it.",
        "11211": "Sometimes insurance companies lobby to make it illegal so they don\u2019t have to pay out your life insurance since you committed a \u201ccrime\u201d. \n\nAlso, a rescue or police team could kick down your door because you are \u201cattempting a crime\u201d",
        "11212": "What the hell!? Please tell me she is out and alive.\n\nMake it illegal, but make the punishment address the root cause of the crime. She needs to know her worth but she\u2019ll never find it in a jail cell.",
        "11213": "My gran thinks you should get life in prison for attempting suicide to stop people from killing themselves, which is ironic because I have tried to kill myself 3 times",
        "11214": "Yes she's okay and doing well! Its been about 3 years now. She was able to get it expuoff her recorded.",
        "11215": "Your gran sounds like she is frustrated that she can\u2019t save people so the only option in her opinion is to lock them up to keep them safe. \n\nI see that a lot, people don\u2019t know how to help so their logic is to put up barriers and restrictions that actually backfire. Someone like me is going to challenge every barrier and every \u201crule\u201d that says I can\u2019t do something.",
        "11216": "That\u2019s awesome! Love to you both",
        "11217": "She's a shitty person, she used to work at a special school and this one kid kept having meltdowns when they did finger painting so she and some of the other teachers kept him after class, held him down and smeared paint all over his face, she was laughing while telling that story and she thought his screaming was funny, I've stopped visiting her because of this, she also called me and my sister attention seekers for cutting and attempting suicide, so fuck her.",
        "11218": "Good job! Allow yourself to continue feel proud. Showering and/or eating a full meal can be challenging and overwhelming activities, and you\u2019ve completed both today!",

But the important thing is that you make the effort to be kind to yourself and move forward. Taking a shower and eating a full meal may not seem like a fete for most, but for those of us who suffer with mental health issues, we know what an achievement even getting out of bed is! You are amazing and you are worthy!",

This gives such a silly and negative portrayal of mental illness suggesting that mentally ill people are \u201cunstable\u201d and dangerous while at the same time painting mental illness as some kind of quirky character trait. It\u2019s neither; mental illness is serious and debilitating for the person suffering from it and it does not mean that said person is \u201cunstable\u201d or a dangerous or toxic person to be around. In fact a lot of people with mental illness just want to be seen as normal and could stand to benefit very much from forming normal healthy relationships with people and they try very hard to do so and to overcome these kinds of unhelpful stereotypes.",

How much help do we need?\u201d\n\nOn our bad days our therapist would ask us what number we were and then would ask us to text him number updates.  \n\nIt really can be an amazing tool for self assessment and then communicating that with the people who need to know what is going on.",

The idea being (between us and our friend who we made it with) that we would never really get to either a 1 or a 10.  I\u2019m not entirely sure why that helped... maybe it helped take the pressure off,  There wasn\u2019t a real \u201cperfect\u201d to achieve or strive for. There were just a couple \u201cyeah this is okay\u201d options. \n\nAlso it was sort of a dark joke between us about how no one is ever that happy and if they are it is probably bad for their health. Idk.. couple depressed people making dark jokes about normies I guess: \n\nIdk.. I like that first frame. It has a sort of unsettling quality to it. It makes me laugh.. like the cake episode in Hyperbole and  a Half.  \n\nThat first frame is sort of a reflection of a lifetime of mistrusting happy people and not believing they could really be happy.. which is funny now, because we actually are pretty happy. And we don\u2019t feel that way anymore.. but it felt important to still include it.. not sure why.  It sort of honors that experience of being in a darker place for so long. \n\nBut yeah I can totally see how it could come off as mania.",

Having social anxiety is not \u201ccommon\u201d in the sense that everyone has it. People are associating getting slightly nervous around new people as social anxiety, but that is completely normal. The problem is, because general people haven\u2019t experienced real social anxiety, THAT is what they think it is, so therefore they tell people to \u201cget over it\u201d. When in reality, they don\u2019t understand and they need to educate themselves. \n\nIm going to use teenagers as an example since mostly teens are on tiktok: as a teenager, a lot of us have anxiety to talk to people at the register when buying things. That is normal. We are young and we don\u2019t have the experience or causality around strangers, especially adults, like an adult would. But, being afraid to the point you make yourself sick to go to school each morning is NOT normal. Walking down hallways and having that itchy feeling that everyone is staring at you is NOT normal.

It\u2019s like how some little kids get hurt and they\u2019re scared, so they act like this tiny cut is the end of the world, when in reality, they\u2019re not dying, but they do need comfort.

And I swear all these creators (not just teenagers) were convinced they had it.  Like you don\u2019t have \u201chyper fixation\u201d just because you become really interested in something.  That\u2019s normal.  And I remember I said this once (in a nice way) and the girl said \u201cno but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it\u201d but that\u2019s not unusual when you develop a new interest.

He told me that if I'm able to treat them effectively through existing therapy, then a diagnosis isn't really a necessary thing to pursue and I really think there's something to that. diagnosis is certainly a big \"valid\" stamp on your symptoms sure, but before that it's a tool for treatment and you first have to work out whether additional professional treatment is needed before you jump straight to that.\n\nfuck people claiming for clout, but I don't think you *need* a diagnosis to be valid in your claim of mental illness",

I guess I\u2019ve learned a couple \u201cfun facts\u201d, but the main takeaway for me is how much I absolutely have no desire to talk about anything mental illness related on social media. Having it is tiring enough, and I don\u2019t want my identity online to revolve around this shit. Personally, I don\u2019t believe there is truly any hope in \u201cnormalizing\u201d mental illness, at least not literally. Acceptance and non-judgement towards people with mental illness is not the same as making changes or accommodations in the way businesses and society works, or on a personal level making small sacrifices or changing behavior to help a person with mental illness function better. This is perhaps too cynical of a view, but I think it\u2019s fairly realistic. Just based off predictive models of behavior,and my own experiences over the past decade of having a mental illness.

I've come to understand it as young people's way of acknowledging when situations make them feel instantly overwhelmed by emotion. I think it's better for people to be acknowledging when they're overwhelmed by emotion, rather than previous generations' tendency to just pretend it isn't happening at all. Of course there are downsides and of course in minimizes what the word trigger means to someone with an emotional disorder, but I still feel like it's actually move in the right direction. I hope!",

I\u2019ve heard people joke that \u201cbinging on Xanax may be bad for you, but at least you get to wake up with a bunch of brand new shit you don\u2019t even remember stealing.\u201d\n\nFor this reason, many medical professionals nowadays seem to be hesitant to prescribe them, and when they do they tend to prefer Klonopin over Xanax given the fact that Klonopin has a longer half-life therefore a lower potential for addiction. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that Xanax is still a very popular prescription drug of abuse in the realm of illicit use. I mean, Xanax has made a name for itself in pop culture, whereas Klonopin and Ativan just aren\u2019t as sexy.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget that Xanax (as well as all benzos for that matter) can lead to very nasty withdrawal symptoms and can cause fatal respiratory failure when combined with alcohol.\n\nWhether you\u2019re experiencing anxiety due to an underlying mental health condition or just the stresses of everyday life, Xanax will obliterate all of those unpleasant feelings and leave you with a very pleasant and relaxing high for a time until it wears off. What happens afterwards is the issue, as is the issue with all powerful anxioltyic substances. Try to be informed as you can and stay safe out there.",

I understand I could've worded my comment better; what I meant to say was more about the image being ambiguous, and the fact that I can see two ways to interpret the message, one really shitty and confusing and another that's actually something I can get behind and that also makes much more sense in the context (so I assumed that's what OP and the people who responded positively to the post read it as). That doesn't change the fact that it was worded very poorly and could have potentially harmful implications.\n\nI wrote my comment for that exact reason: to point out that the wording implies something potentially harmful that I strongly disagree with and feel that people really shouldn't internalize, and that there actually was a positive message to be found there, I just would have phrased it differently; I tried to specify what that positive message was because I didn't want people to see it and think: \"Oh, this image says my worth should be decided by other people, and many people upvoted it, so there must be some truth to that.\" Because no, that's false. But you should not decide *for* other people whether or not you're worth their time and affection - because even if you migh not believe it yourself, you do deserve that. And you also have to allow people to be there for you and love you, they can't do it if you don't let them. That is something I agree with and consider a healthy message.\n\nSure, maybe it's not what the author of this image intended. I personally believe that doesn't really matter in the end. The only important thing is what we read in it and what it means to *us* (and I feel like this is even more true with mental health, as everyone's experience is so different and unique and subjective). I fully subscribe to the concept of the Death of the Author - the reader is the one who ascribes the meaning to a text (or any other piece of media for that matter), the author's intention is ultimately inconsequential.

Obviously, the depression makes you feel the opposite intensely, but I\u2019ve found that breaking it (incredibly hard to do) in any capacity has helped slowly but surely loosen depresssions grip. \n- part of the above, keep moving. No matter how small the effort (maybe it\u2019s sitting up instead of curling in a depression ball) keep moving and building that inner strength. Anything is a positive impact and hopefully you can keep building. \n- try to muster the energy to meditate. There\u2019s many guided meditations on YouTube, Spotify, and of course specific apps. If you\u2019re with kaiser, calm app is free. It really helps center your mind. R/meditate is a good resource also. \n- exercise if you can. This one is so, SO hard in depression.

In a nutshell, most of the symptoms for a \u201cpanic attack\u201d listed in the DSM are physiological symptoms like rapid heartbeat, etc. \n\nI could see the symptoms from OP\u2019s post describing more generalized anxiety, but it\u2019s still rather anecdotal compared to the DSM. Yikes this reply is getting long, but the DSM is seen as the psychiatric bible. There is some bias, as with everything and should also be taken with a grain of salt, but professionally it is regarded as truth. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a professional MH provider in the US, I believe NAMI and SAMHSA have provider locators on their websites.

She dealt with CPS on his behalf to allow him to legally stay with us given the fact that we were minors at the time. We were together from ages 16-21ish. My mom went thru so much. He even called her mom and they were extremely close. We got him clean off of drugs and even got him into college where he earned his degree. I left to do a Disney internship and 2 weeks before Christmas and before i was about to come home, he broke up with me via text message. He continued crashing with us for another couple of months because my mom and i were still so confused as to what to do considering he was basically family at that point. But it turns out he'd been sneaking around for the past few weeks with some other girl, so much so that he would have her park around the corner so that he could say he was leaving and he could get to her without anyone seeing. Once he was finally out of our place for good he stayed with that girl for another year or so, and has since been bouncing around from girl to girl and has also let the drugs back into his life again. Once he moved out he also tried to turn all of our mutual friends against me by spreading malicious lies about my family and i. This was years ago now at this point, but to this day we still don't know why he snapped and did what he did. Within the span of about 2 weeks he was a completely different person than he had been ever since we'd known him. My family and i wanted to maintain a mature relationship with him even if him and i had been broken up since we'd all been thru so much together over the years, we just assumed he'd always be family. He clearly had other plans. Since I've had time to go over it so many times, I've come to the conclusion that he never loved me or my mother and he was just using us for as long as he possibly could to gain as much as he could before he would eventually split. I believe he's a sociopath with no conscience. He is a great actor. I still see him around from time to time because of our mutual circle of friends, but i gave up long ago trying to understand him. We just had to accept the simple fact that we were used up until we had nothing left to give and he had gained everything he possibly could from us, and then he simply ran away. It took us years to recover and i think my mom still has issues considering she thought of him as a son for all those years.

        "12009": "Hey! I'm sorry you had to go through that!   \n\n\nThe one person that has it better is you, because that person isn't in your life anymore! People that don't deserve to be in your life will not be in your life. It's their loss, it's because of their choices.   \n\n\nI'm going to tell you a story.  There was this person that I considered a good friend in college. He tried scamming me with those pyramid schemes, I didn't get scammed. I was really really nice to him in college, and even till the point he tried scamming me. When I was approached, I figured I'd check it out, and I was just going to talk and find out what's up. When I told my brother and my parents, they said it sounded fishy, and although I thought it was like that as well, as the guys I spoke to seemed that way, I thought the person I considered my friend would never do that to me. I gave him every single benefit of the doubt, and he had lied to me to my face. I did some research and found out which company they were from, and I found out that it was a scam. I felt really bad that he did that that time, and I vented to my friends for 3 days. But I'm extremely grateful that it happened because I genuinely cared about him till that point, and I found out he was unworthy of friendship and loyalty. Friendship and loyalty are extremely important to me! The universe was helping me see that person's true colors, and I'm happy that everything that's ever happened to me happened to me, you know? Everything that's happened makes me who I am.  \n\n\nYou're perfect the way you are! We should always accept ourselves for who we are. If there's something you don't like about yourself, you can change it, but only for yourself, not for others. Others should accept you for who you are! You should accept others for who they are as well! :) Always be okay with seeing a person's true colors, good or bad! :) Whoever is meant to stay in your life will, and whoever isn't will not! :)  \n\n\nAs for what you're going through, when things are hard, we grow! Perhaps what we're meant to do, we will do better with what we learn from the times we're suffering! Perhaps you're meant to start a company, and you think of an idea because you're going through this.  \n\n\nLet me tell you something, each and every single vibration influences the course of the timeline. Even if one single thing was different, we wouldn't be here! So perhaps, this was meant to happen so that you'd meet a special someone that you're meant to be with! You never know! We're not supposed to know everything beforehand! What's meant to happen will happen! :) What we can do, is be ourselves, and have the right intentions from our side! :)   \n\n\nKarma is a teacher! The universe will make sure they understand that it wasn't okay to do what they did! :)  \n\n\nYou have a purpose, and that purpose is fulfilled by you being yourself! :) You're one in seven billion! You're perfect the way you are! :)  \n\n\nYou said that you were suicidal. I'm here if you ever need someone to talk to! :) I want to say is, life's about being happy. If you're depressed, I really think you should take a break, and try to connect to yourself. Try to understand why you feel what you feel! Try to understand what you want from life! Connect to yourself! It might be scary at first, but just because it's hard and scary doesn't mean it's bad, you know? It's like untying a knot! Talk to your mind! :)\n\nIf your job is toxic to you, you should quit! You're allowed to not want to be near people that affect you negatively! You're allowed to not do things you don't like! To eventually become happy, it's about getting into a neutral state of mind! Once you reach that, you'll be able to get to a state where you're happy all the time!\n\nEmotions are very important, and it's important to not suppress them, or avoid them! They can exhaust you, and be a weight on your chest as well! It's important to stay connected to them! Your heart doesn't lie to you! :) Listen to it! :)\n\nLife's about being happy, and doing what you love! Life's about having fun, and spending time with your loved ones! Life's about finding out what you're passionate about, and doing it! You're one in seven billion! You're perfect the way you are! Everyone's great at something, and everyone can be great at something if they do what it takes! Everyone is a genius in their own way! If you haven't found out what you're passionate about, keep looking! Here's the thing, people love watching passionate people do their thing! Whether it's streaming games, or singing, or whatever! Do something you want to do in life! Follow your passion! Follow your heart! If you do what you're passionate about, everyday, when you wake up, you'll embrace the day instead of going \"Ugh, I have to work today\", you know? It might not be sunshine and rainbows all the time, but it's something you want!\n\nLife is like a marathon! It's about the journey, and not the destination! You run for yourself, you run with your friends and family, and eventually, you'll find someone that you want to run the rest of your life with! ;) Do what you want to do! :)  \n\n\nIt's important to understand that there are things out of our control, and one shouldn't worry about things that we can't do anything about! What we do have control over, we can do something, so we shouldn't worry as much! :)\n\nI really wish this helped! :) I am your friend! I'm here if you need someone to talk to! :) Take care! :)",

For generations we have built trauma and shaped it into what we need it to be to fit. So being older and trying to problem solve for the helpless adults in ones life came easy, because they were helpless, or still are, but nonetheless it has been a cycle one way or another. Responses to kindling fears and past actions and situations that one was put through. Some cant handle it and their mind consumes them when in reality its a defense mechanism for survival. Thats all human nature has ever been and will ever be, adaptations for survival. Whatever we get exposed to we have to figure out a way to protect ourselves. Everyone is different. Thats what makes us all unique. The science behind it all is crazy because we have studied it in every other animal. Humans are no different, except with consciousness and the ability of self recognition humans are advanced enough to prefect efficient survival tactics if people actually took it more seriously.\nIn a nutshell, every cause has an affect. Any response that triggers the nerve receptors in your brain to go off good or bad yields that effect. Whatever makes that response happen is the cause. No matter what happens it will always result in some kind of effect.",

Mostly positive, however I've come across other traumatised people who I can only describe as being jealous. \n\nI've been called a psycho for being open. Bombarded with victim blaming and sly digs about the fact I'm in therapy. Such as \"A, B and C happened to me and I don't need fucking therapy\" like? Yes you do, Sandra. A,b and C are very traumatising experiences and the fact you're so mad that I am in therapy tells me you feel like you need it too and are feeling sadness that you don't receive help too so you're projecting.  \n\nI'm dealing with it young because I've had therapy since I was 7 years old! it's because I exhibited extreme symptoms early on and because I'm physically disabled and already was receiving care from specialists. All it took for them was a referral. I was in a position where I could get help. I'm not lucky for it, I was only in that position because I got an infection as a baby that ate my hip and femur. I'm sick to death of being called lucky for being so unwell. \n\nI'm 21 and I've been in therapy most of my life. It's taken me 10 years to actually be open about my trauma. Mostly because during those 10 years I was still stuck in traumatising situations most of the time and the past 2 years has been the first time I've been in a position where I am safe to speak about what happened to me! \n\nI'm not mature, I'm just emotionally aware. I wouldn't even call it emotional intelligence because I'm only smart and able to help when its somebody else's problem. I have a mental illness, I've had it since i was little so I'm obviously gonna feel relatively comfortable talking about it. \n\nThe worst for me? Being called an attention seeker. The only attention i seek is a spotlight on mental illness and the impact it has on our kids. I don't want other people going through what I did, and I try to relate when I hear a horrible story. This seems attention seeking but really I just want people to feel less alone. I've felt isolated and alone my entire life and I just want people to know that others have been hurt and that they aren't on their own with the feelings that hurt provokes. \n\nIdk. Mental health is so hard to advocate because of dumb archaic social rules about not speaking of unsavory things. I say fuck that because the hurt goes on behind closed doors and will only end when that door is opened.",

You'll feel a lot better just ignoring the voting system of reddit overall.  \n\n^((Although something I) ***^(have)*** ^(learned during my time on reddit, is that people are more likely to downvote posts/comments that are complaining about downvoting, for this very point.

To tell someone who has most or all symptoms of anorexia but isn\u2019t underweight that they don\u2019t really have anorexia because they \u201cweigh too much\u201d is extremely invalidating. Yes, this was even done by medical professionals and still is a lot but it\u2019s stupid. I know people who have binged and purged a lot. But if they are underweight they first get diagnosed with anorexia just because theyre underweight. And if they get to a normal weight it changes to bulimia when they should\u2019ve been diagnosed with it from the beginning. That\u2019s part of the reason this is a harmful idea. People are wrongly diagnosed because of what they weigh rather than a diagnosis being based on the disordered behaviours. Because of this, some people don\u2019t get the proper help they need because doctors don\u2019t listen to them. And many people are too afraid to ask for help because they will likely be invalidated by stupid doctors who don\u2019t think they are \u201csick enough\u201d because they don\u2019t look like Eugenia Cooney or whatever. People also often don\u2019t care as much about people whom are overweight with an eating disorder. I have bulimia. I\u2019m not underweight. People often encourage me to lose weight even if they KNOW how I\u2019m losing it. People also kind of ignore that there is anything wrong with me because obviously I\u2019m not skinny so how could I have an eating disorder? It\u2019s harmful to me and others who face similar treatment. I do think ednos exists, however anorexia is anorexia no matter what weight you are. I also disagree with calling it atypical anorexia with normal/overweight people. Again, harmful and extremely invalidating. The behaviours are the same so why should the diagnosis change. This LITERALLY hurts people physically, emotionally, mentally, and I cannot stress that enough.

You're welcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why You Can't Judge a Therapist by Their Facial Expressions**\n\nDad: Seeya tonight, hon!\n\nMe: Dad, your teeth.\n\n*(My dad has a partial with two fake front teeth because of an accident involving a kayak and our garage and a dog leash. Don't ask.)*\n\nDad: Oh yeah! Thanks!\n\nMe: You need to keep a set in your office, Dad. You CANNOT forget those.\n\nDad: Sometimes I forget.\n\nMe: And what do you do?!\n\nDad: I just don't smile for the whole session.\n\nMe: DAD. You cannot do that to people. You're going to give your clients a complex. If Mister T didn't smile at me for a whole session I'd contemplate why he suddenly hated my guts for, like, 36 hours at least.\n\nDad: Well, most of my clients don't treat therapy like an improv comedy show like you and Mister T.\n\nMe: STILL.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMe: Um... mom? Did something... happen... to your face?\n\nMom: Oh yeah! I got stung by a bee! Is it noticeable?\n\nMe: Uh... yeeeees.\n\nMom: Well, it's telehealth, so I doubt it will bother anyone.\n\nMe: You kinda look like you're winking, though.

You can't wear those!\n\nDad: Shit! I'm already late!\n\nMe: Change your pants, dad.\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**They Don't Always Tell You Everything (But You Knew That)**\n\n*(Noticed that my mom pauses and sighs every time she reaches the bottom of our staircase.)*\n\nMe: Rough journey from the second floor again?\n\nMom: No... I'm just thinking about one of my clients. She's so depressed, and the stairs from her apartment seem so endless and daunting so she doesn't leave much. Every time I go down our stairs, I think about her, and I think, \"I did it. You can do it, too. I know it.\"\n\nMe: That's really sweet, mom. You should tell her.\n\nMom: *(Takes out her phone, and emails her client.)* Good idea. I just did.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*(My dad makes homemade wooden toys. He's really into slingshots lately.)*\n\nDad: Look, Selfless! This one is for my co-worker, and this one is for \\[your son\\], and... man. I wish I could give this one to a client of mine. He'd love it.\n\nMe: Well, you know it's probably not a good idea to hand out weaponry to your clients. But you should tell him you thought about how he'd like it.\n\nDad: Do you think I could send it to him anonymously?\n\nMe: I *hope* you're kidding.\n\nDad: I... am...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Edited to add:\n\nHe just got home.\n\nMe: Dad, how was in-person?\n\nDad: *(Stops dead in his tracks, swivels around to face me)* It.

However, I held it together and made it to my session. About 5 minutes in, my T asked if there was anything on my mind. I completely broke down and everything came spilling out; the suicidal thoughts, the severe anxiety, and how I had reached my limit. I was crying hysterically and could not not catch my breath or control myself. My T stared at me in silence for about a minute and then asked if she could sit next to me. She sat right by me, took both of my hands, and I realized she had tears in her eyes. She began to cry, and apologized for not realizing the severity of my depression and expressed sympathy for my pain. We were able to discuss a plan that would involve my doctor and psychiatrist getting involved. She assured me that she would be there to help me work through this, and I promised to be more honest with her. \n\nI have never had a session that felt more healing than this one.

It's what we do.** \n\nYour therapist might be kind, or a good listener, or funny, or smart, or legit attractive, or *any of the things people are.* If they went to a shit-ton of school because they really wanted to help people sort out their messed-up lives, they're probably going to be at least a few of those things. And liking someone who gives you positive attention? Yeah, that's just human nature. There is nothing. NOTHING. To feel bad about there. \n\nI get that we pay them to be in the room. Like, I know. I do it, too. We give them money because they're specially trained to be in the room really well for us. **But they're still people. And we're still people.** And when you spend a lot of time with someone, relationships happen, yo. \n\n\"But I wish my therapist was my mom and that's weird.\" Is it weird to wish you had a mom that showed up and listened to you and supported you? Nope. That sounds real normal. \n\n\"But I want to have sex with my therapist, and that's weird.\" Is it, though? It just sounds like you happen to be attracted to people, and your therapist is one of them. Hell, have you ever thought a cashier or a waiter or the landscaper at your place of employment was hot? Yeah, me too. \n\n\"But when my therapist goes on vacation I think about them and I'm sad and that's...\" Don't even say it. \n\n**Therapy relationships are relationships. Therapists are people. We're going to** ***feel*** **things, friends. And I think we could be a little kinder to ourselves about how legit and totally ok those feelings are.** \n\nWe know our therapists feel stuff, too.

My anxiety loves to fill my head with reasons as to why someone is late and it often gets me to the thought that they could have died. This time it was actually true. I called my therapist and I got a weird and quiet answer from someone else who sort of sounded like him. He asked who I was, I told him and asked for my therapist, saying that this was his clinical phone number that was posted on his website. He told me that he was his cousin and he regretfully had to inform me that my therapist has died. I was and still am in complete disbelief. This doesn't feel real. I have had a few therapists before, but this one has been my most favourite and comforting and effective therapist. We had just begun doing EMDR session to treat my past traumas, but I've been working with him for nearly a year now. He has always made sure that I feel heard and that everything I tell him was safe with him. He always made me feel appreciated. He even made personalized audio recordings for mindfulness meditations that I could do between our sessions. He has provided me with free sessions because I am so in debt from a series of concussion injuries over the past 5 years. I love this person and their counselling has changed my life immensely in the time that we had together. I am shattered to know that he took his own life. I imagine the weight of all that he was carrying and all that he wanted to do felt like it was too much. He was on a mission to help as many people with their traumas so that they could live with less pain. He has done that for me, and I can't believe his part in my journey has come to such an abrupt and unexpected end. My heart aches and I feel broken right now.

        "12662": "Long but hopefully helpful/relatable. Yesterday, I had my termination session with my previous therapist of over a year. I was constantly terrified she was ready to ax me, and despite the fact that we talked about that fear, I still convinced myself to just end things and start with someone new. I mourned for weeks.\n\nTo my surprise, in our last session she actually shared that working with me was like \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d and that our connection was genuine. She admitted to processing, in her own time, the heavier things I shared\u2014that she didn\u2019t just walk away from the emotional bombs I dropped robotically and that she really cared. It was a huge relief to know that sometimes the vulnerable things we share stick with our therapists and they do their own processing with them. Hearing that made me feel incredibly grateful and humbled to know I wasn\u2019t as alone in dealing with the weight of those secrets. \n\nThere was only so much she could share within the treatment framework without triggering my feelings of being a burden, but in that moment I *really* needed to hear that our work mattered to her on a personal level. The thing that nearly broke me was hearing her voice soften as she said, encouragingly\u2014and almost sadly: \u201cAlien, not everyone in your life is going to leave you.\u201d \n\nIt was such a loaded statement because she knew why I terminated. I understood it as her way of saying, \u201c*I was not going to abandon you*\u201d. \n\nIt was an overarching theme to the session. She asked me to trust that people will stick around if I will allow it. The subtext was deafening. Our relationship, as we both had anticipated, was culminating into the same defensive pattern that I had followed my whole life: ending my relationships before they could end me. \n\nIn earlier sessions she revealed hopes that this treatment might model a new and healthier path for me (I\u2019m really sorry that it didn\u2019t). Yet, she still found a graceful way to investigate the fear behind my decision without making me feel ashamed or judged. Thanking me for my honesty and vulnerability, she reassured me that the way this played out was *okay*. She thought I ultimately used good judgment in deciding to work with a more specialized therapist who I could learn to trust the same. \n\nShe set the bar really fucking high for all of my future therapists\u2014my life is so much better having met her, mainly because she first validated my trauma and also fostered my very first safe space where I got to process a lot of \u2018forbidden\u2019 emotions I had never admitted to anyone before. I appreciated that she left the door open for me to drop in again, despite not offering to continue contact with other former clients. My heart is full, I have so much gratitude, and I hope that others with strong attachments to their therapists can feel safe enough to trust that not all of them are actively trying to get rid of us.",

        "12679": "I had seen this psychologist 11 times over the course of about 8 months in 2019/2020. He was consistently late to every session (both in-person and virtual) but always prompt about ending the session on time which bugged me but, since it was just a matter of a few minutes, I tolerated it.\n\nOur last session was a virtual one in September 2020. I logged in five minutes before the start time and waited. After I had been waiting for 17 minutes (at which point he was 12 minutes late) I got fed up and decided I was sick of his tardiness, so I closed the browser and no-showed. To be clear, I still paid for this session even though I did not attend it. \n\nFast forward to two weeks ago. I've been really struggling and having a hard time finding another doctor, so I decided to give him another shot. I made an appointment (he has switched back to in-person sessions) and texted him the day before to confirm.\n\nThe next morning, I showed up but his office was locked and the lights were off. I called him, no answer. I texted, no response. Nothing. I instantly had a feeling like I had been ghosted, but constant feelings of abandonment are common with my condition so I tried to put that thought out of my mind. I tried to remind myself that he's a professional, that it makes no sense for a *psychologist* of all people would resort to that kind of petty tit-for-tat...and decided instead to assume he was dealing with a personal emergency and would get back to me when he could. \n\nFast forward again to yesterday. It had been 16 days since the scheduled appointment and I'd not heard anything from him until he called me and \\~very kindly\\~ left a voicemail saying he would be happy to start fresh if I had learned to respect other people's time, and if that was the case then I was welcome to book another appointment with him. \n\nI mean. I just. Wow.\n\nOn the one hand, he's got a point, I shouldn't have no-showed and I had even been planning to apologize and explain my reasoning during the session *he* no-showed for. On the other hand, it wasn't exactly a waste of his time - he was conducting virtual sessions from his home. It's not like he got up, got dressed, and drove to the office only to be stood up - *as I had.* And he was still paid for the session just the same as if I had shown up. Forgive me for saying it, but our no-shows were not the same. \n\nSo I declined the offer. I'm not interested in seeing a psychologist who engages in exactly the kind of retaliatory behavior that I'm trying to fix in myself. \n\nI don't really know where I'm going with this post. But has anyone else experienced something like this?",

I am frequently asked if a theraputic relationship can \"downshift\" into a friendship.  Again, I explain the temporary nature of the relationship, and how I wouldn't want any ambiguity to hurt them, but, selfishly, there are many who I would love to stay friends with, because so many of my clients are phenomenal people.\n\nA few years ago, in an ethics training, the trainer asked me if I ran into a client at the grocery store after ten years had passed, and they asked me to get a cup of coffee, would that be unethical?

I'm also going to start journaling after each session so I can remember what we talked about and how I felt about that session after it. I guess we are going to have to talk ABOUT therapy a lot IN therapy which is probably going to be annoying but hopefully insightful so we can both be sure I'm getting what I need from our sessions.",

I\u2019m pretty sure I have adhd.\n\nIve also started keeping a reflection journal and a thought journal. These remind me of my earlier thoughts and I get to explore them/map them out.

Then, in the evening, of get out my journal and physically write out those notes.\n\nIt really helped me because 1) I was able to get those thoughts and fears out of my head and 2) Going back to them helped me reevaluate those feelings and expound on them if necessary.",

There were two times I tried and I had to wait to see if there were any cancellations. My other T always has time for me. He has less clients and he works for himself instead if in a practice so he sets his own schedule.",
        "12966": "It isnt so much that I'm angry, just frustrated. Kinda feel like I've worked really hard to get some insight on WHY I'm like this but I cant stop to rest and everything moving forward is just going to be a lot harder.\n\nEdit - also the week between my appointments with Eyebrows feel like a million years so it's nice to be able to have another session even if it isnt with him. My other T is good too (and more experienced), but often during sessions he will say stuff like \"Did I just say that to a client?\" Or \"I shouldn't say this, but...\" so far it hasn't been anything I see as really out of line for therapy but I do kind of worry one day he will say something I dont find appropriate or something and we will have a rupture.",

I have a feeling that at times it\u2019s a way of avoiding vulnerability",

If I\u2019m feeling sad, it\u2019s a lot easier to talk/think around the sadness than to just sit and feel it. The speed of my thoughts dull the sharpness of the emotions.

Each day I\u2019d limit myself to those 5 lines. That makes it way less daunting and it\u2019s doable as I could finish it in a minute or so. Then when it\u2019s near my appointment, I\u2019d go back and color code. As I reread my entries I\u2019d color each section according to- Green=good. Yellow=could\u2019ve been better. Orange=definitely not good at all.  Red= horrible, worst day. I showed it to my T and he was genuinely impressed and surprised. By doing this I have a simple track of what I go through each day and he could read it if he wants to without it being too much. Color coding also helps me to notice any patterns. I finished my first book last week. Lasted from Dec 17th to Jun 3rd. I could dm you pics for example if you\u2019d like.",

They come up to let me know something but I\u2019m often out of tune with what they actually want to say. \n\n\nI\u2019m curious if synesthesia like you have is the historical basis for the concept of seeing auras around people?",
        "13133": "It's such a broad term for a bunch of different things where sensory wires are crossed. And these are going to totally sound nuts.\n\nI think there are over 80 recognized types of synesthesia. Some people see colors for different letters and numbers (grapheme-color synesthesia), some people associate tastes with words(lexical\u2013gustatory synesthesia), and there's a ton of others.\n\nI have a couple types:\n\n1. People have colors to me. Synesthesia can either projective (see the color when you look at someone) or associative (look at someone and see their color in your mind's eye). Mine is associative. So everyone I know has a color. Inexplicably, some people have two colors and I've yet to figure out why. My therapist is a lighter sage green but sometimes she's a butter yellow. My best friend is plum. My husband is a tangerine orange, my youngest son is a primary blue, my oldest is lemon yellow, my mother is slate gray, etc etc.\n\n2. I have spatial sequence synesthesia, which means I see numbers and whatnot in a 3D space. When I think about the months, I see them in a circle like a clock. When I think about a year, I see it on a timeline where the older years go to the left backwards and the more recent years are to the right. Basically abstract ideas I can \"see\" in time/space.\n\n3. I have chromesthesia, which is where sounds have colors/shapes. Music when I close my eyes, elicits a kaleidoscope of colors and geometric shapes (and I swear I'm not stoned, haha).\n\n4. Pain-color synesthesia - pain has a color for me... like when I broke my pinky toe on the corner of a door, that pain was bright light blue. When I sliced my finger open on a mandolin, that was bright yellow.\n\n5. Ordinal linguistic personification - basically some letters/numbers/words have colors or feelings or associations. For example, to me, gray and grey are different colors. Some objects to me are either even or odd. There are other quirks to this too.\n\nSo yeah, the tl;dr is that it's totally nuts. I haven't told my therapist about my synesthesia yet haha.",
        "13134": "It's good that you're able to be present enough to know when they are showing up. I've only been doing this for a couple months, and I still get wrapped up in being blended with them.\n\nAnd I think you're right about the auras! That particular type of synesthesia can either be projective (so you actually see it) or associative (you look at someone and see the color in your mind's eye). Mine is associative. But the projective type is definitely like the auras!",

While the processing of life events and the significance of them your day-to-day is very important, I believe that THIS is how therapy can be SO powerful!!! You took a huge risk in articulating this to your therapist. It speaks volumes about your relationship with her, and also about your (growing) strength. I think of the therapy room as kind of a relationship laboratory. It\u2019s a safe place where you can take risks, try out different ideas or ways of being, see what comes up, and eventually bring these new things into your other relationships. I imagine that being so brave and so vulnerable and having such a wonderful reaction from your therapist will help you take similar risks/look out for yourself in your other relationships.

I went back and we spoke about it and everything else and I realised my own personal issues of people not treating me too well came out to play and I took it immediately really personal when in reality the guy made a mistake. I apologised for how I was and he kept reassuring me that I don't need to and I've been seeing him for months since. \n\nEverybody is only human and make mistakes and I guess when we look at who we go to for help and they make a mistake it can feel so defeating. \n\nYou done really well and I'm proud of you.",

I believe you can do it. \nI immediately closed my eyes and covered my face when I realized I didn\u2019t want to look at her and I said it to her while fully hiding, she did not judge and then asked if I wanted her to turn away, which helped so much, I was able to uncover my face and cry and tell her how it made me feel, abandoned and forgotten. And she reassured me that I was NOT forgotten and proceeded to tell me what was going on, on her end and she apologized. \n\nBasically what I\u2019m trying to say is trust your gut with what you need to be able to communicate. In my case it was covering my face and hiding to feel safe.  You got this. (:",

It's, in general, the trait of mental stress.  \n\n\nAnd, rather than accepting that, society shuns you for experiencing mental stress, says \"not my problem\" to the point of defining you as fundamentally \"other\", and then sends you to a very hidden, often unmoderated person being touted as specialist. Which, some do certainly help.  \n\n\nBut the medicalized model of therapy as \"is you\" and not \"what happened to lead to these behaviors being expressed, which may include both nature and nurture aspects\", is a huge critique of modern therapy not talked about nearly enough.  \n\n\nAnd this meme is a great example supporting that barbaric way of handling those in emotional distress. It's not fair to the therapist or the client to frame things solely and only as an individual problem.",

I\u2019d actually like to apologize because you\u2019re right about both the medical model and the prior psych wards. You\u2019re also absolutely right and I agree that therapy isn\u2019t what defines you, your thoughts don\u2019t define you, and your diagnosis doesn\u2019t define you. To me, at least, it\u2019s all about living for/toward your values. Additionally, I would like to at least offer up that there is a newer generation of therapists and flexible older generation of therapists who are more person first and recognize the impact of life experiences on a person and the environmental stressors in their lives. I understand and apologize if I may have accidentally missed part of the purpose of your response.",

People are tripping all over themselves to add \"trauma informed\" to their psychology today profiles.  I feel like the medical model, while still a huge part of psychotherapy, is also somewhat waning.  Insurance anchors it to some extent, but there's a big push to incorporate understanding of trauma into therapy.",
        "13219": "Fair enough. Thanks for the compassionate response. Sounds like you've had some good experiences with therapy, and perhaps this post was even meant to celebrate that.\n\nMy experiences with therapy, across six years and over a dozen practitioners, has been more negative than good. And I've come to the point of actively critiquing the practice as a whole. Not every corner of it, and do believe it can and has helped some people in some settings. But not nearly enough is talked about the limitations and failures. And I've found problematic attitudes with therapists of every age range. It's anecdotal of course.\n\nAt any rate, apology accepted!",
        "13220": "What does trauma-informed mean to you? It feels like a buzz word term that's starting to lose any actual meaning. Anyone can *say* they are trauma-informed, but that doesn't mean they actually treat trauma effectively. \n\nTrauma can also be placed either within or outside the medical model. So I don't see how \"incorporating trauma\", in and of itself, discourages medical model style practice. But, to clarify, semantics and operational definitions for terms get very tricky with all this. And it seems easy for two people to actually agree on underlying concepts while also using terms differently.",
        "13221": "I\u2019d have to agree with you about \u201ctrauma-informed care\u201d as someone who\u2019s worked on the technician level at a couple different psychiatric facilities. Employers, or treatment providers, advertise being trauma-informed yet the sentiment is so quickly lost once that trauma actually manifests itself. There certainly are those in the field who genuinely bear in mind individual traumas but it seems to most often be thrown out the window or completely ignored rather quickly when the prescribed treatment isn\u2019t working as effectively as envisioned. On top of that, many other technician level employees have no idea what that being trauma-informed even means or what it is trying to accomplish. I can\u2019t speak to how therapists or doctors treat the phrase but so many technicians could care less. There is obviously a difference in education for the positions but the impact can be just as detrimental.",

It has made all the difference. \n\nI love the part about your therapist allowing you to care for them but not take care of them. This goes both ways in my therapy relationship too. It\u2019s somehow what makes the relationship feel most reciprocal - therapist acknowledging that my feelings of care for her are normal human feelings and welcome, not examined or put off as transference. It makes me realize that I am capable of relationships and feeling connected even when I have had very few experiences in the real world like this.",
        "13237": "Wow I love this. And I totally agree. My favorite things about my therapist are the details. Whenever I am starting to panic in a session and get overwhelmed, she leans forward and sits at the very edge of her couch, looks and me and softly says the truth. It\u2019s so comforting. She also will notice when I dissociate and softy say \u201chey, come back\u201d. And when I do finally finish freaking out and I calm down and look at her, she smiles and says \u201chey. I\u2019m here\u201d. I love her so much.",

        "13396": "Thanks :) \n\nYeah it feels weird at the beginning, speaking for myself it gets better with time, but I also still struggle sometimes with being entirely open after almost a year - getting there :) \n\nDuring the first sessions he would more start with \"is there something you wanna talk about\" or \"do you have a topic today?\" but I was totally overwhelmed and overthinking that question. I have the feeling since I addressed that he is using more the \"how are you\" variations to kick off the session and after a short small talk I'm calm enough to go into the deeper stuff. \nHe explained to me that it isn't rude at all if I'm not asking back because it's about me and it's a different question coming from him compared to friends or co-workers. But as you say it's a unique relationship and it takes some time to adjust to it, which is also a good topic to talk about. We actually just recently got into that, so as you see even after almost the double amount of your time I'm still learning about the therapeutic process and relationship itself :) And it's not my first time. So don't be too hard on yourself :) \n\nI hope that was at least a bit helpful since it was just me rambling about my personal experience and having a hard time translating my thoughts :)",

I can suppress sadness or guilt well enough, but fear suppression for some reason always ends up being anger. Attack is the best defense, etc.\n\nIt may also be that I always see fear as the main emotion in this kind of scenario. FEAR of being embarrassed. FEAR of being the guilty party. FEAR of being abandoned (jealousy related). FEAR of being disappointed in myself. \n\nAnd what is anxiety if not for a lot of fear?",
        "13455": "Similar thing with me. Instead of anxiety, I just act very evasive and emotionally-distant. I've only just recently been able to get in-touch with my angry emotions and I was startled how much is there - literally a lifetime's worth of anger balled up inside me.\n\nI wasn't able to express anger in childhood either but I accumulated a lot due to a similar inability to express my social anxiety, and a need to 'tough out' my problems. I suppose it's worth asking yourself where your anger is coming from?",

Obviously emotions are not clear cut, but I always thought the most logical chain would be fear -> anger?\n\nI guess for some people fear is like a \"blanket\" smothering anger and when fear gets removed you feel how angry you actually are. Is that how it is for you?",
        "13459": "Insecurities. Including anxiety.\n\nUpon further examination it looks like fear is directed towards things that we actually encounter while anxiety is directed towards things that we haven't or even do not actually encounter. Both stem from insecurity though.",

I was worried that I was losing touch with my intuition and running behind logic since I spend way too much time explaining away my worries in a logical manner. Listing pros and cons in my head etc. This book just taught me that I still have my intuition. \n\nAnyway, I mentioned this book to my therapist yesterday and she immediately went on to say \"may be anxiety is a gift too, all emotions are a gift from the universe. They have a purpose to fulfill. And my be they linger on until they're heardand their purpose is fulfilled.\" \n\nAnd I'm trying to process this perspective. Putting it out there for whoever needs to hear this",

        "13462": "When anger is not acceptable or safe to show, it gets masked away just like other emotions can. My impression is it's actually one of the most frequently masked emotions, because it's usually more outwardly directed/visible than other emotions. \n\n\"Safe\" includes \"safe for the environment\", too. So it's not just a matter of not showing anger to stay safe yourself, but also for example for children who are parentified (put in a place where they are the caretaker for a parent of both of them, or the family) showing anger often is not done because of its negative impact on the other, to-be-protected people. Not as a conscious choice, mind, but as general adjustment to the environment.",
        "13463": "The premise for how I experience it is that the reason for was I was angry was not acceptable and reprimanded, hence shame and fear got called in to cover up my anger. It was totally valid looking back, but I was scared of even giving people a hint of how I felt, cause I knew that the shame, bullying and fear was easier to deal with than anger on how I was treated.",
        "13464": "I think this one is my favorite!",
        "13465": "Heh me. Like no I do not want to talk about my trauma. My T is really good at gently steering me that way though",
        "13466": "Okay so I am a therapist, and also go to therapy myself- and I think this is significant growth. Feelings of worthlessness would lead to people not discussing their interests, or thoughts that seem 'irrelevant' to the problem at hand. Or because they think their thoughts and interests are worthless too. Being able to do that over time not only tells me that there is a significant bit of rapport and trust with the therapist, but also that this person is a lot more comfortable being vulnerable, a lot more confident about their worth, and a lot less guarded!",

People even talk about their \u201ctherapist voice\u201d, \u201ccustomer service voice\u201d, \u201cteacher voice\u201d etc. I can usually tell there\u2019s a filter when he has a change in facial expression and then pauses before saying something.",

Makes me think of those memes where the paper scroll rolls out and is endless",
        "13539": "I know the feeling. I've been trying so hard to be a \"good\" patient, who never says anything silly, that I haven't been honest about my real thoughts.

        "13540": "It's a challenge because my therapist is helping me to both trust my gut more while *also* recognising that my interpretation of reality is subjective and can be changed. So I need to believe my own impressions, but also not take them at face value? It makes sense now, but it took a while for me to wrap my head around.",
        "13541": "Glad I'm not alone in this. It really shows how much of what we feel depends on interpretation. My first thought about this was actually \"why would you think your therapist cares this much, you're just another patient.\" As if patients aren't important? I've had this conversation with my own therapist, and I've since tried to challenge my assumptions, but this comic made it so clear and obvious.",

        "13544": "Yeah! Ts like that make it normal and natural to confront and understand our reality! I do have nagging thoughts about finding another therapist but that will have to wait until I get hired and am financially stable. Companies aren't upfront with their hiring practices and it's frustrating to keep searching and attending interviews or not getting any. Share more of your sessions with T with us!",

        "13546": "I think about everything! I\u2019ve made 28 of these. \n\nIn all seriousness, the structure and method of therapy is really fascinating to me, it\u2019s simultaneously the most boundaried/professional and most personal relationship I have - there isn\u2019t really anything like it and so things happen in therapy that don\u2019t happen anywhere else. It\u2019s a delicate art too. So I think about those things after session and a comic strip condenses those thoughts down to a few squares.",
        "13547": "It makes me irrationally anxious to think about my case being discussed in a room full of people, even though I've known for years that they do this.\n\nI guess some people might not have it though, if their provider is in private practice?",
        "13548": "That\u2019s interesting. I am probably just projecting because I\u2019m working on taking things people say at face value and not being skeptical or suspicious about their true feelings/intentions. \nI envy your therapy experience. Mine has been underwhelming. Group therapy on the other hand is extremely helpful and invigorating though.",
        "13549": "In my experience, its 1-2-1. But is different in different settings. The person doesn\u2019t know the client/patient. The info that is shared is only in so far as to contextualise what needs to be talked about. So if i was worried about a safety thing and whether to intervene; that gets discussed. But broadly speaking its focussed on clinical techniques and how the clinician is responding. Its not a rehash of the sessions. \n\nWorking privately there is still supervision. At least in UK. You just pay for it rather than being in house. Its a requirement for ethical body membership",
        "13550": "Thanks for taking the time to explain!",
        "13551": "Lmao! Yeah, shit\u2019s not working for me either, but I like hanging out with her every week.",
        "13552": "As a therapist, I can say it for a fact that your therapist would find this really funny if you showed it to them.",
        "13553": "OMGGGG this is me 100%\n\nI so want to send this to my T. I'm pretty sure he'd laugh. Pretty sure. Lol",
        "13554": "It needs to say at the end \"but I'm going to keep coming back and giving you my money because I at least have someone to has to listen to me that I don't feel as guilty for talking about my problems to constantly.\"",
        "13555": "Totally feeling this. At some point I was getting stressed out before sessions because I had to come up with something to talk about. \n\nTherapy didn't really help me...it's weird. Most tips they gave me I heard already from 1000 self help youtube videos and ted talks. Before therapy I always dreamed about how I'd go there and finally all the problems I had would dissolve but instead it was just another thing that didn't help me :(",
        "13556": "I\u2019m saving this to my meme collection. I don\u2019t know if I will ever gather the courage to show it to her, lol",
        "13557": "Lol",
        "13558": "Hi, i understand completely why you feel so. If I may, I'll just say one thing. The \"therapist\" wasn't able to help you but not \"therapy\" in general. One therapist doesn't mean therapy in totality will never work out for you, that one therapist didn't work out for you! Please keep looking for that one therapist that will get you and will help you get through this. I assure you they exist.\n\n\nI too am a therapist who also has mental health problems. I too go to my own therapist and yes it takes a while to meet that one therapist who will help you succeed, but you will. \ud83c\udf3b",
        "13559": "first of all thank you for the warm words and you're right I didn't mean to say therapy in general, just the two therapists I saw. In that regard I do continue my own therapy of being mindful, meditating and working out which helps so much already.\n\nIt's so hard looking for the right therapist tho because you have to make an appointment first, wait 1-2 months and even then it's only after 2-3 session one can make a decision if this is the right one, this whole process is tiring so I'll wait till I search for another one.",
        "13560": "I totally understand that. Therapy has become quite the luxury and the time period between you wanting a session and you actually having a session, is rather a long time and usually you can be in two completely different states then. So I get that. It can indeed be taxing. \n\nTry to find a therapist who can understand this concern of yours. I'm sure they will atleast try to accomodate you. Or you could always make appointments beforehand for the whole month. That has worked quite well for me. :)",
        "13561": "My therapist: \u201cAnd how does that make you feel?\u201d\n\n*Me, after 5 minutes of pondering in silence*: \u201c.....bad\u201d.",

Although there is lots of shared trauma, everyone experiences racism slightly differently and I'd say it's important to tell your therapist how it is for you. Perhaps ask them what training or experience they've had on working with race.",
        "13642": "As a therapist, I think it\u2019s my job to address this from the beginning. When I have a new client come in with different skin color, I want to address that ASAP. I want to talk about that difference and how I plan to work with them, what my own history is, and I want to know if they are comfortable with that, because if not, I want to help them find someone they are comfortable with.

However, there are additional layers of complexity when the perpetrator and oppressed work together. Managing these and using them in therapeutically constructive ways while keeping one's own defensiveness in check (the therapists) is no easy task and can often derail things even with the best intentions. There can be something inherently painful about being faced with a \"White\" therapist, evidence of structural inequality, racism, privilege, and a host of other things. It can even foster feelings of inferiority and a sense of being looked down on (which may or may not be happening).   \nYes, there is also greater scope for healing and reconciliation over the longer term but the work is advanced and to easily carried out without a high level of maturity and self-awareness on the part of the therapist. Few training institutions that I know of prepare clinicians for this an instead train them to work with diagnoses. \n\nThe minefields are many. For example, I might mention something that Steve Biko (black consciousness leader of which I am a fan) wrote. And this is then experienced as a microaggression where the client experiences me forcing them into a version of blackness constructed through my whiteness, i.e. that they should also be a fan of Biko.  The client may never raise this, and the damage remains unaddressed, and if they do they are often met with defensive reactions, e.g. \"that's not what I meant\" or \"I'm not racist you know\" instead of \"Oh I see what I did. I'm sorry. I'd like to hear more.\" Or, \"the racist shop attendant ignored me\" and the therapists say \"That happens to me too\". Or, \n\nWe need much much more work in this area.

The idea that asking a therapist an incredibly complicated question before you've had any time to get to know each other in order to determine their competence is ludicrous!  \n\nAnd what makes it worse is the idea that there is a singular psychological impact.  The only competent answer is \"it depends.\"",
        "13649": "I haven't heard about this being done a lot but I'm curious, maybe try asking r/Psychotherapy\n\n\nAlso sometimes this can come across a bit weird, like I (a PoC) remember getting a cab once and this white dude immediately started talking to me about trump this, trump that.\n\n\nI mean maybe it was just an attempt to make a convo, or he's just super politically active, or he was just empathizing or trying to gain woke-brownie points? Idek man I just wanted a ride lmao, but at the time I kinda took it differently. (He was fortunately against 45 so it could've been worse.)\n\n\nIt feels like **my existence is inherently political.** I can't explain how many times I'm just in a room with all white ppl and then somehow politics get started and of course ppl start looking at me like a fucking zoo animal and it's awkward & unpleasant.\n\n\nLike when I walk down the street, I don't feel as if people are looking at me as a human being, I feel as if they're looking at me through a political lens? \n\nI'm not sure if I'm explaining this right sorry, but yeah it's like my skin immediately ignites the political train of thought in people's mind.\n\n\nThis could just be my social anxiety speaking as well so take it with a grain of salt. \n\n\nWhat's even more silly is when people lable human rights as \"politics\", as if it's debatable lmao\n\n\nBut I appreciate you being self-informed and educated on how important it is to create a secure space for your patients!\n\n\nSometimes it's just a doomed if u do, doomed if u don't type of situation, but that doesn't mean it's ur fault obviously.\n\n\n\n**I reccomend you just put up a little book, symbol, of some sorts representing your views. For example, a pride flag.**\n\n\nMy first T had a calendar with a pic of a WoC in a protest against a line of police. At that point I didn't even knew anything about her but it gave me an idea that she's not stupid.\n\n\n\nJust a warning though: this can definitely backfire on some bigoted patients or if they're schizophrenic and think the government is out to get them",
        "13650": "I\u2019m also a therapist and do the same thing! It\u2019s definitely our role to make sure we are able to provide the care that individuals are looking for. I work in community mental health so referrals are limited but I do my best to make sure my clients know that should they want/need a therapist that looks like them or reflects them, that\u2019s always a viable option.",
        "13651": "I know you only have good intentions and are trying to be empathetic but I'd be cautious about having this approach. You may just end up alienating your clients. Some people may appreciate it but others just want to be treated like regular people and not have their therapist immediately emphasizing their differences and otherizing them. If I had a therapist immediately launch into a tirade about my ethnicity then I'd feel quite uncomfortable and I probably wouldn't come back. If I want to discuss racism and my ethnicity then I'd bring it up myself. If your client is from an ethnic minority group (or any other minority group) then they are probably already very aware about your differences and don't need them reinforced. My current therapist is an old white Christian guy and I appreciate that he just treats me like he would anyone else whilst still being open-minded and non-judgemental about our cultural differences. I've had younger white therapists who feel the need to go on and on about my minority status and tell me how I'm oppressed by society and, honestly, it's quite infantilizing and just comes across as virtue-signalling and them projecting their sense of white guilt onto me. It also ironically has the reverse effect of discouraging me from speaking with them about experiences of racism and discrimination as I don't want to encourage their behavior or make them feel bad about themselves. That's just my two cents though.\n\nEdit: Obviously, that's not to say I think you should dance around the subject of ethnicity either. Just that you should leave it up to the individual to decide how much they want to discuss it. Just asking a simple \"where are you from?\", \"what's your cultural background?\", or a casual \"I like your name, what language is it?\" is great way to approach it imo as then that gives the individual the opportunity to discuss the matter in depth if they like or to just answer matter-of-factly and move on to discussing the problems that they're there to see you for.",

Being sensitive to possible issues that could arise in therapy because of different cultural backgrounds/class/gender, etc.of course is of value. But to overtly bring it up with a client because it is your, the therapist\u2019s, concern is not good therapy. Well intentioned, but still bad therapy.",

        "13656": "I can imagine all the.... ' my therapist decided not to work with me because I was black' posts that would result. You can work with the issue of difference in any context, and to highlight skin colour as soon as the client enters the room seems some what judgemental and unempathetic to me. The opposite to what we ars supposed to provide. \n\nBut that may be just me.",
        "13657": "I agree, but also I don't think POC should just seek out POC as therapists. \n\nIt would depend on the kind of therapy you're after. Personally I've had an excellent therapist who is a white woman but she's compassionate as hell, and also understands racial/ cultural issues because of her own life experience. But also I haven't seeked therapy related to my own cultural issues. It's been entirely about me, and that's kinda how I want it",
        "13658": "Second this :) I\u2019m both a social worker (not doing therapy, but case man) and a person of colour. Bringing up race and culture without being prompted is a little...rude, almost. If people don\u2019t allude to it, don\u2019t ask. Sometimes we just want to be treated like regular old people with regular old problems. That being said, I usually ask where people are from (like what city/how long you been here etc. Some people answer it with their ethnic background too)- and that\u2019s often enough to get a grasp on whether they are cultural/tied to their community or not. \n\nAlso just want to say that there are many Ts who think they are culturally safe but therapy with them is disastrous. I\u2019ve had a number of therapists not from my background who have all said \u201coh yea totally i\u2019m 100% culturally and spiritually safe to talk to\u201d and then they go and do damage by pushing against my beliefs. So....we\u2019ve got work to do, for sure. Would love to see more diversity in the field\n\nLastly - to actually address the photo in question. Hell yea, interview your therapists to make sure they will work for you. Ask them anything and everything including political issues if needed. That is trauma too.",

I\u2019ve had a few white people randomly message me checking in on me and giving me a laundry list of all the things they\u2019ve done to support the Black Lives Matter movement. They also ask me what else they should do to help. It\u2019s well intended but I don\u2019t really want to have to think about the movement 24/7, and I don\u2019t want to have to feel pressured to validate their deeds and opinions.",
        "13661": "I\u2019m tired and I goofed and replied to the wrong person. \n\nYou are right, you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel like your existence is political and I apologize for that. I have several LGBTQ+ clients so I do have a few books in my office like The Red Crayon to help clients coming in for the first time to feel more comfortable. \n\nI work at educating myself continually. I know I\u2019m not perfect, but I focus on forging that therapeutic relationship with my clients so they feel comfortable with me and I encourage them to tell me when I make a mistake so I can fix it and learn from it. There\u2019s always going to be differences between me and my clients, as we will never have the same background or experiences, so I want to talk about that and explore it. Maybe not all therapists do, but I was actually taught that in school. \n\nI also understand how difficult it is to go to therapy, as I attend my own counseling sessions, too, I know how it feels from both sides of the couch. It\u2019s not always easy talking about your feelings.",
        "13662": "Yes, exactly! Our community is small and not very diverse, so I feel I have to address those issues immediately for my clients. It is their decision whether or not to move forward, but I want them to know I\u2019m not afraid to address it and work on it ongoing with them.",
        "13663": "I hear you. I don\u2019t think I launch into a tirade. I generally approach it more like \u201care you comfortable working with me as a white woman?\u201d If they say yes, then great, I drop it and move on. If not, I give them referrals. If they ask me questions about my background, approach, theory, etc, yay! I welcome that and we have that discussion.",
        "13664": "I think it's definitely worth putting on the table because some clients need \"permission\" to discuss certain topics, but I agree that there's a tendency for certain types of therapists to try to push the issue.",
        "13665": "Yes. I encourage talk about differences. I prefer for clients to interview me and ask me questions, as well. I do display books in my office that are about gender equality (from The Red Crayon to Dara Hoffman-Fox\u2019s workbook) and I also encourage my clients to tell me if I make a mistake.  I am human and am not perfect, but I am willing to correct myself and learn. I do also try to read/educate myself. I recognize I am not going to be the right therapist for everyone, and that\u2019s ok. There are some clients who I know I cannot work with, and that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m fine with giving them referrals out. \n\nWhat I do know is that today\u2019s world isn\u2019t easy. It feels like we are being hit by one thing after another, and the anxiety and fears from the beginning of the year have turned into overwhelming anguish and outrage. I am absolutely anti-racist and not afraid to talk about it because I see it as part of my role as not just a social worker, but as a white person. I get that for racism to stop, I have to make sure I\u2019m calling out others on it.  I am simply trying to help one person at a time. That may not be good enough for some people, but it is what I can do.",
        "13666": "I have had two male therapists do this due to me being a victim of domestic violence and them being concerned that if we were going to be doing trauma work I might get triggered by them being males.

        "13669": "Just a little advice: ANY therapist who says they're 100% competent or safe in ANY area is a charlatan",

        "13671": "I think that's perfectly fine then and I would imagine that your clients probably appreciate your openness. I've just had bad experiences with tone-deaf therapists (not saying you're one, of course!) making a bigger deal out of it then necessary. I don't hold it against them though as I understand they're just trying to be empathetic and they're probably not aware of it as any clients who have felt uncomfortable by it have probably felt it would be too awkward to tell them.",
        "13672": "I\u2019m also a therapist, and I don\u2019t address visible differences or cultural differences as they come to light unless initiated by the client. I thought a lot about this concept, and I think it depends on how clients come into your care. I\u2019m in private practice, so my clients elect to work with me. I also work in a metropolitan area, so there is a lot of access to therapists. Since they\u2019ve initiated our work together, I assume they\u2019re ok with how I look and our potential differences. If they were being assigned instead, I\u2019d probably take a different approach.",

It is of great value to find a way to express to clients that there\u2019s no topic that is off limits to discuss, but it\u2019s not our job to assume what may/may not be comfortable or worth discussing for the client.",

I\u2019ve worked in Indig communities where i\u2019m from, had the exact same feedback from them.\n2. Spirituality is super important to me. I would say as a culture, we are fairly steeped in it and it impacts our worldview whether we want it to or not. Had a T tell me our scriptures are \u201cjust a book written by some random person.\u201d Nah that aint it. So disrespectful. I screened her thoroughly before choosing her as my T too, and she said she was fully open to spirituality etc, but obviously her biases leaked thru in a very minimizing way. \n3. Overly clinical pathological approach to care. I was explaining a phenomenon that occurs within my culture, T says \u201ci think you may have bipolar.\u201d Pissed me right off because members of my community can completely identify with this phenomenon ....it\u2019s very common....and had she listened, she would realize that. It felt very diminishing of my reality. \n\nJust a few things that I can think of off the top of my head. Thanks for asking :) that being said...i also have had good therapists who are authentic and genuine about the things they dont know and the mistakes they might make. I have completely loved them :) it really just depends on the person",
        "13678": "Thank you. The comments here certainly are making me think...\u201dam I addressing this properly? Am I meeting my client\u2019s needs?\u201d I know I\u2019m not perfect by any means, but I do promise to keep challenging and educating myself to be better.",
        "13679": "Point taken. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.",
        "13680": "Hopefully, this explanation helps: When working with clients who are not white, I will typically address it during intake by pointing out the fact that I am a white woman (\\~if you hadn't noticed), but if they ever feel I've misunderstood something due to those differences in lived experiences, I want them to feel safe addressing it with me. It breaks the tension a bit (if there is any) and opens up that conversation.\n\nI've been largely educated by Black people and grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood, so I feel no discomfort. But I want my clients to feel understood, and know they can comfortably have that conversation with me if at some point they do not.",
        "13681": "The thing is that POC are a minority, thats why we don't have equal amounts. \n\nIts probably not really possible to have what you are saying unless you want to force some POC to become therapists",
        "13682": "Thank you for this! And I'm glad you have found good therapists too. \n\nThis made me look at my work from a different angle. I like to think of myself as being open to any and all cultures whether I agree with them or not, but I struggle with those cultural issues that clearly are not good for the person's well-being. Most extreme example of this is the gypsy (not exactly the right word but as close as possible) in Finland, in which families have massive wars with eachother which leads to violence and even deaths. I have heard some of them say that they would just like to change to normal \"white people\" clothes and move but their culture is holding them back. \n\nSorry for the long comment, I got a bit carried away here oops",
        "13683": "So long as you have that attitude then I think you're doing great. Remaining open to the possibility that there might be things you could be doing better or ways of approaching things that might be more effective is the key imo. So long as you're making an effort to be open-minded and to understand other's experiences and address their needs then I don't think you have anything to worry about. That's all anyone can really ask for.",
        "13684": "Okay, it doesn\u2019t have to be similar numbers, but rather it could be similar proportions of the population, like however many white therapist divided by the white population and POC therapist divided by POC population?",
        "13685": "But even if something seems on the surface like it\u2019s not good for a person\u2019s well-being, that doesn\u2019t mean that in the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s actually that bad. It depends on the client and what they want too. If they think it\u2019s unhealthy, then it is. But for example: my sis was stressed out cus she had post-partum & her mother in law was coming down to visit. MIL and husband did not ask whether MIL can come and stay for a few weeks. Sis mentioned this to a T who was like \u201cwow they didn\u2019t even ask you?!\u201d And my sis was like...\u201dno....she\u2019s family...she doesn\u2019t need to ask. That\u2019s not how it works for us.\u201d Which is true. And it blocked my sister from venting and getting out how stressful it was because it kept coming back to boundaries. She came home and was like \u201cshe\u2019s coming whether i like it or not - i\u2019m not telling her that she can\u2019t!\u201d Thus she didnt go back to this particular T. I don\u2019t know any MILs who ask permission to come over in our community... it\u2019s seen as very rude to deny family. But when MIL comes over, she\u2019s also cleaning and taking care of the kids which is helpful, in the bigger picture\n\nRe: gypsy culture. Once again it comes back down to what the person wants. If a person says they want to leave, then yes, it might be time to talk about boundaries and supporting them to integrate more into western society. Even if those families are violent and chaotic, if someone doesn\u2019t want to leave you can\u2019t make them. That culture sounds similar to street culture....there\u2019s so much violence and dysfunction in the homeless pop but i\u2019m there to just listen and see what intervention points are going to be accepted by said individual.\n\nSorry that was a super long response. Apologies :)",
        "13686": "How do you know thats not the case already?",
        "13687": "You do have good points! Culture is a tricky thing to deal with since I \"don't have any\" meaning that I am part of the majority. What also influences my thinking is that I used to work in a prison so my views may be skewed in a certain direction... \n\nThank you for giving me stuff to think about!",
        "13688": "\u201cIn 2015, 86 percent of psychologists in the U.S. workforce were white, 5 percent were Asian, 5 percent were Hispanic, 4 percent were black/African-American and 1 percent were multiracial or from other racial/ethnic groups.1 This is less diverse than the U.S. population as a whole, which is 62 percent white and 38 percent racial/ethnic minority.\u201d\n\n\nhttps://www.apa.org/monitor/2018/02/datapoint\n\nI also don\u2019t think that the rates of that would have improved significantly enough in the past 5 years, since economic mobility and access to education, health care, and knowledge of people\u2019s rights are not functioning well enough for POC in America.",
        "13689": "But you do have culture! Even if you are part of the majority - you have roots in europe, and maybe that\u2019s something you can explore a little bit more. \nYeah, well there you go. It would have been important for you to identify unhealthy behaviours & address them in your prison job, especially keeping in mind individuals would be released back into community. So i get that. But yea i would just reflect on where we get our ideas of healthy/unhealthy behaviour & how that\u2019s been influenced by our own culture. We all got unconscious biases which is ok!\n\nAnyways thanks for being open to listening. Hope you have a lovely rest of your day :)",
        "13690": "Fair enough, though I still don't see how to get those numbe s higher. \n\nI think it would have to be indirect (i.e getting equal education and opportunities)",

        "13804": "Also, I make sure patients can see a clock to help them use their time as they think best. I\u2019ve found that when they bring up something important at the end of a session and they know the time, it\u2019s often because they want help from me in talking about it at their next session.",

        "13807": "Really needed this. I got upset the other day when I saw my T looking at the time. After I left the office I realized that I was being stupid. It was a busy day and he had one more client. I felt selfish for thinking that way, I wished that I had more time. I feel so bad but I understand now. There will be other sessions. Even though sometimes you might have a lot to talk about there might not be enough time to bring it up. As I have this little pattern figured out when it comes to our discussions next time I\u2019ll think a bit more before I bring up something heavy that might take time to talk about!",

And one assignment my therapist gave me was to write a timeline of my life (it\u2019s helpful when trying to process trauma). \n\nMy therapist was out that day so I went to her intern and she decided to go over it with me. She told me AT THE END OF THE SESSION that I should tell my parents about the person who raped me! It opened a door and the rest of the week I was a crying mess. I ended up switching therapists and talking to another lady who has a similar life story that gave me better advice\u2665\ufe0f",
        "13809": "Also, as a therapist, I put a clock where my clients can see it as I want you to know how much time we have left so you don\u2019t bring up a huge issue when there are only minutes left....it\u2019s better if it\u2019s earlier and we have time to work thru it (at least enough for you to calm down enough to go home safely)",

        "13818": "It is for sure! I\u2019m a big eye contact-maker but not constantly steady. I guess part of it is I\u2019ve gotten used to the pattern my therapists have of looking around. But it\u2019s definitely obvious when they look up high on the wall :) I think also knowing where the clock is is part of it too. There\u2019s a sense in which, at least for me, intended looks are different from just kind of gazing around. Hard to describe. I do appreciate the whole not having to like, turn around or look at a watch thing so that they can keep their attention on the conversation and not distract both of us by making some *super* obvious movement to look. \n\nAlso: your name amuses me even though I have no idea what it means. Makes me laugh anyway",

Like go to long term therapy, journal, reflect, make big life changes and stick to them, forgive their self and others, learn to love their self etc etc. I feel like this pressure that this is what you\u2019re supposed to be doing at all times. If you\u2019re not working on yourself, healing yourself, you are somehow broken or lacking or lazy even. Hmm.

As for societal pressure, our culture is all about appearances which is such a harmful mentality.

        "13896": "Yeah, something like that. It\u2019s not just that they can\u2019t live your life, but they can\u2019t fix you because the fix is more often than not a matter of learned and practicing healthy behaviors and cognitions, just as a guitar player has to train themselves to hit chords and strum effectively. The guitar instructor cannot train the student\u2019s body for them.",

I pick one every week to send to my therapist and talk about at my telehealth counseling appointment.\n\nRandom note - I based the therapist in my comics on the first counselor I saw when I started therapy - but now the therapist character is just representative of any experience I have with my mental health team (psych, specialized trauma counselor, CBT a counselor, psych nurses, social workers, etc), regardless of who it is. In fact, the real-life mental health professional who inspired this comic is female. But given that these comics are a series, it just \u201creads\u201d easier if I keep the character consistent.",

        "13930": "Thank you for sharing. The language of non-compliance in the medical and mental health systems does so much harm and obscures the issues at the root of patients' perceived \"non-compliance.\" The threat of being labeled as such is also often held over people's heads and forces them to go along with treatment providers that are actually causing them harm or at least not helping. \n\n(For ex., if you're on disability at work, being labeled non-compliant could threaten your ability to remain on it, so instead of advocating for yourself you might have to go along with treatment that isn't a good fit for you or a provider who is causing you harm).",

        "13934": "Love this. This is probably one of the most important messages to share around in therapist communities. \n\nTherapists use a lot of psychobabble to move responsibility away from their competencies and push it on clients.

        "13954": "This is something you will really need to address in session. It wouldn't be helpful for you or the therapeutic relationship to avoid it. And some good may even come out of it.

Early influence in my life with midwives and hippie types taught me how to be comfortable in my own skin, in all my icky bits. Respect to those who can't, cptsd and other scars, but I wish everyone could get a taste of that wonderful free feeling at least once. It's been healing for me",
        "13976": "I would never see a therapist who might at all be in my gym or social circle.   It's a sign you're with a peer instead of a mentor.",
        "13977": "Yeeep, just gonna repress that. Lol.",
        "13978": "Oh my god \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
        "13979": "OMG. Did she say anything!?",
        "13980": "Is that considered trauma bonding? I would not be able to look at mine in the face after that, nor would I want her to look me in the eyes either lol.",
        "13981": "I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not in the US?",
        "13982": "I think maybe you\u2019re right... the playing field of vulnerability in your situation is totally level.",
        "13983": "Right?? Like suddenly my story of seeing mine at work isn't nearly so bad",
        "13984": "Oh for sure, it\u2019s definitely a cultural thing. Americans are so fucking weird about bodies and over-sexualize everything and then make it shameful.",
        "13985": "Met my European professor in the locker room once when he had just left the shower. He's a chill guy, chatted for a bit, then he grabbed a towel. Still really awkward though, longest \"don't look down\" moment of my life.",
        "13986": "Oh absolutely and that\u2019s definitely what she did. It\u2019s just one of those \u201coh my god are you serious\u201d things. Of all the possible things on planet earth that could have happened in that moment, my T seeing me stark naked was literally the last thing I expected.",
        "13987": "I agree. I don\u2019t see what the big deal is.",
        "13988": "True dat",
        "13989": "I\u2019m legit going to ask her next week \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
        "13990": "Came here to say this!! I literally snorted when I read that!!",
        "13991": "SAME! \ud83d\ude29 I\u2019m definitely going back bc she\u2019s great, but I might have to have a blanket over my head for the duration of our time together \ud83d\ude02",
        "13992": "I 100% am going to. I deal with uncomfortable shit via humor, so I know she\u2019ll get a kick out of it.",
        "13993": "Oh for sure, I\u2019ll definitely bring it up. And you have a good point!",
        "13994": "Is this considered a trauma bond? Asking for a friend! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
        "13995": "I see her next week! And yup, you know the drill from the military. It\u2019s all the same essentially. Naked in front is a bunch of strangers on the regular. But it being my therapist is so different",
        "13996": "Same same same \ud83d\udc4f",
        "13997": "Haha honestly!! I approach most things with humor, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have something clever to say in session next week. I have to immediately bring it up or it\u2019ll be the elephant in the room!",
        "13998": "I should take these kinds of odds to Vegas!",
        "13999": "Exactly!",
        "14000": "Exactly!",
        "14001": "Right, like can we EMDR all the embarrassing shit I\u2019ve ever done in my life, but let\u2019s start with this one \ud83d\ude02",
        "14002": "Oh yeah, definitely bringing it up. Now that I\u2019ve slept on it, it\u2019s at the \u201ccringe but funny\u201d point. When I told my best friend (who is also in therapy so we often share stories), she laughed so hard she cried. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
        "14003": "I\u2019m 34 and my T is 60.",
        "14004": "Weird flex",
        "14005": "I mean I don\u2019t really mind being seen in general had it been literally anyone else.",
        "14006": "I mean I\u2019ve never run into her elsewhere, she\u2019s 30 years older than me, she\u2019s not in my social circle or peer group. We just happened to unknowingly go to the same gym/yoga studio.",
        "14007": "Even if you live somewhere as big as Manhattan, there\u2019s still a good chance you might accidentally run into your therapist out and about somewhere - including at the gym. Especially if you see a therapist who works within a short drive of your home. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a peer, just that you two live in the same city. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
        "14008": "Mentors don't go to gyms?",
        "14009": "How on earth do you figure that? If you live in a small town chances are you're going to run into your T going about their daily life as you're going about yours. It doesn't mean anything",
        "14010": "The fact that your therapist goes to your gym would be a sign that they\u2019re a peer? How are you possibly finding out beforehand whether you belong to the same gym?\n\nAnd since when are therapists supposed to be mentors?",
        "14011": "I didn't know a T couldn't be a peer",
        "14012": "I'm almost certain she didn't see / notice.",
        "14013": "I don\u2019t see how it would be. Our next session was just as casual, highlighting how we were surprised to see each other, and the importance of being physically active (same type of convo you\u2019d have with a friend/acquaintance in sinilar circumstances?).",
        "14014": "Indeed, what gave it away?",
        "14015": "Boobs, for instance. Don\u2019t even get me started lol",
        "14016": "When I used to go to the Y pre-covid, I always mentally prepared myself for the possibility of a naked client because I knew a bunch went there lol",
        "14017": "Completely tangential, but it's weird that people are this prudish about nudity right? I mean not individually weird, but weird as a society. Like, it's just a meat mech.",
        "14018": "Good luck, op! May the eye always roll in your favour! \ud83d\udc40",
        "14019": "Omg please update us on how it goes, if you feel comfortable. \ud83d\ude05",
        "14020": "Oh for sure!",
        "14021": "Hahaha I feel you OP \ud83d\ude06",
        "14022": "My life is weird. : )",
        "14023": "I understand. Upon further reflection I remembered when a university art student friend asked to paint me nude because I am an older curvy mama type, not the typical androgynous fit people who volunteer for their classes. When I heard from a co-worker that the piece was for sale and hanging in a local coffee shop I felt the cringe! Humbly, I had forgot about that!",
        "14024": "Well, if you're about the same age,  same sex, same interests (yoga), it could have been predicted. I'd prefer not to be too close to the same as my therapist. It's just a personal choice.   And not mentor... more like someone more objective than a peer would be.",
        "14025": "Maybe that\u2019s for the best \ud83d\ude02",
        "14026": "You two are some brave and confident folks. I guess in my situation, it would not happy in the first place because there\u2019s no way I would get naked in a public environment but they handled that very well! I personally would never want to see my therapist again after that lol.",
        "14027": "People are much more prudish about nudity here",
        "14028": "Haha I bet there\u2019s all sorts of stuff you have to mentally prepare for as a therapist going \u201cout into the wild\u201d.",
        "14029": "Oh it\u2019s definitely weird/shitty. Especially in America, where we make it so taboo, but then oversexualize everything to the point of shame. Like I said in my OP, I am very used to changing or showering in a group shower from marine corps barracks and whatnot, so in general it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. It was more just the fact that my therapist got an eyeful of my T&A while I\u2019m in the post-yoga zen state.",
        "14030": "I agree that it's weird. I dont care if other people see me naked. I dont want people to see me if they dont want to, so I close my curtains and whatnot. But if someone sees or wants to see me I dont mind lol.",
        "14031": "I definitely will!",
        "14032": "So you're suggesting that people should avoid seeing a therapist who's the same sex and similar age as they are?  That's very rigid, and often impossible.  And you wouldn't typically know your therapist's interested, so that wouldn't work either.\n\nUltimately, it's always a possibility that you'll run into your therapist.",

I\u2019d absolutely love to see more of your art with a different story line.\n\nBut I really think you need to be in therapy with a woman instead due to your ongoing transference.  If y\u2019all had a longer working relationship than a few months I might think differently. Or if this wasn\u2019t a pattern with you or  such a heavy focus. \n\nThis is getting uncomfortable from all angles. How about if this was a dude repeatedly telling his female therapist how he wanted to fuck her? Not okay.",

        "14179": "Therapists are used to clients bringing up transference issues and are typically trained with how to respond.  An ethical therapist may allow the client to share their feelings then they could explain how romantic transference is not an uncommon thing for clients to experience.  They may then opt to discuss things like how the client may be looking for intimacy from a nonjudgemental and safe source which is why these emotions can spill out towards a professional.  Think about it, the therapist may be showing more kindness and interest than a client has ever gotten from their personal relationships simply because the therapist is trained to discuss very personal things in a supportive atmosphere.  It is no wonder some clients fall for their therapist and they often find it helpful to talk about it with them.  \n\nHowever, I saw a post regarding romantic transference the other day where the therapist kept prompting the client to go into deep detail on their sexual fantasies of the therapist.  It seemed like the therapist could be filling their own ego and desires when encouraging detailed accounts of the sexual fantasies.  Transference issues are completely normal and can even be expected but they can be tricky to navigate in discussing the transference while maintaining boundaries and the integrity of healing.",
        "14180": "Transference is when the client wants to play out a dynamic with their therapist, which they otherwise would\u2019ve played out with someone else. \nFor example, here, the person says they want their therapist to adopt them. So the person is transferring feelings they have for their parents towards their therapist.",
        "14181": "He knows. He really enjoys reading them and thinks they\u2019re pretty great.",
        "14182": "Idk why you are getting downvoted. If anyone looks at OP's post history, this dude is taking advantage of them BIG time.",
        "14183": "Oh yay I'm glad to know my comics are inspiring others. I'd love to see yours!",
        "14184": "Doesn't always work that way. I have a female therapist and I'm a straight woman. I still want my T to adopt me and to have sex with me",
        "14185": "Not sure why you got downvoted. You\u2019re obviously going off of previous comics that raised red flags. I enjoy all these comics but her therapist has been acting inappropriately...",
        "14186": "Before downvoting, people need to look at OP's post history. Their therapist has crossed so many boundaries and seems downright creepy.\n\n>when we started talking about dating. He suggested I go to social gatherings and find someone there, strike up a conversation. Since I like older men, he said I should probably go up to them (\"since you hold the power. You have all the tools. It will be easy for you. If it were me trying to approach a young woman, that would be much harder.\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He started speaking in this fatherly way that I never experienced before, about how when I do choose to have sex, make sure it's with someone that I really, really care for and that it's my choice and never, ever have unprotected sex. Don't let anyone inside of me without protection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We also discussed pornography that session and I told him how I don't like how I feel after watching it. He asked me why I watch it. And I replied, \"to get off on it\" and he asked to clarify whether I masturbate to it. And I said yes. Then he asked me what kind.\n\nNone of this is normal or healthy. I really hope op stays safe and finds a better therapist.",
        "14187": "I can't remember exactly, but this is the gist of it. \n\nHe ended up steering the conversation to the self and said that my fantasies aren't really that important to the bigger picture of who I am and my purpose, he also recognized that he and the last guy I had a crush on were/are filling the role of a positive male role model that I didn't have while growing up. \n\nWe keep coming back to the subject of transference. And he's pretty certain it will go away within a couple months, but he did leave it open and said that it might be a good idea to consider a female therapist because he thinks transference slows down the therapeutic process somewhat. I asked him if he was concerned about it and he said no. He trusts that I'll make the right decision in regards to my treatment and that he knows himself well enough and promised that I will never be taken advantage of within our therapeutic setting. He said our relationship will always be therapist/client until he dies.",
        "14188": "Funniest part about it is that they can provide neither!",
        "14189": "Tony Soprano vibes.",
        "14190": "[deleted]",
        "14191": "Ohh, thank you for explaining. That makes sense. I didn't get that the person was implying adoption because I related to the comic differently.",
        "14192": "Unpopular opinion here. I thinking saying the therapist taking advantage of them big time is a big stretch to make. Maybe some of the things the therapist said could of been phrased better. But when your discussing porn reliance and transference talking it out is how you figure it out. Things like porn preference and fantasy\u2019s tie in a lot with that. Just because the client is crushing on the Therapist doesn\u2019t mean the client shouldnt be able to move forward and discuss these things to better understand their porn use and their transference.",
        "14193": "I might share! I\u2019m a little worried about anonymity buuut I do want to share. :)",
        "14194": "True, but if you history is intense attraction to off limits male authority figures, it might make sense to avoid replaying the scenario",
        "14195": "Funniest but I think also most healing. If I texted my T and said I wanna have wild monkey sex with you it would trigger a very mortifying conversation, or perhaps several. But I know she would never *ever* act on it. It makes the therapeutic relationship a really safe place to talk about this stuff because I know no matter what I offer she will never do the things I want her to do. I don't have to worry about my feelings for her being taken advantage off",
        "14196": "I took a quick dive into their history and wow, this therapist has crossed so many boundaries and seems a bit predatory. I really hope OP stays safe.",
        "14197": "Let me know if I'm wrong, but you might have missed the full comic. There are 4 sets, and the last one mentions adoption.",
        "14198": "These are good points. But based on comments, I believe there was a post with more inappropriate things (therapist giving compliments to OP, telling them to seek out older men, etc.)\n\nEdit: I thought the post was deleted but I guess it's not",
        "14199": "Maybe try it on a new account?",
        "14200": "no point, because they can't avoid male authority figures forever. family elders, a boss at their job, a doctor, there's always gonna be someone. so i think it's best to work through it with a therapist who's equipped to deal with it, instead of staying forever confused by these feelings. they're not gonna just disappear. \n\nand there are men on this sub who talk about sexual transference towards their female Ts and they always seem very embarrassed by these feelings, so there's no need to say things like in your first comment to shame them more",
        "14201": "If you were my client, I'd ask you about what you are getting out of the therapeutic relationship that is so special...I always approach the parent and/or sexual attachment feelings as an expression of an unmet need...What are you craving from your childhood?   What do you wish you had in your partner?   \n\nAlmost every time, the client feels like the therapist listens, hears them, and cares about their wellbeing...and they didn't even realize that this was something that they wished they'd gotten more of from their parents in the past or their partners in the present and more recent past.   \n\nHopefully, your therapist is skilled enough to use that transference to help you seek those aspects in your non-therapy relationships -- to express your needs and have a realistic expectation that in a healthy relationship your needs will be adequately met.",
        "14202": "Whoops! You're right, I didn't swipe at all. Hahaha, thanks for that!",
        "14203": "I wasn\u2019t suggesting OP avoid male authority figures, just that she would probably be able to better navigate that pattern with someone who wasn\u2019t the object of her desire. \n\nI sincerely do not intend to shame anyone and I apologize if it reads that way. I will try to chose my words more carefully. \n\nI still stand by my statement that you all may feel differently if a female therapist was posting and saying about how her male patient texted her saying he wanted to fuck her. Reads as inappropriate. \n\nI do feel like there is a large trend in this community to focus on the therapeutic relationship (mainly transference of emotional and sexual feelings) towards the therapists instead of the actual content or personal growth and insights gleaned from therapy.",
        "14204": "I'd suggest googling \"erotic transference\" in therapy. This type of transference is normal and yes, healthy, in therapy. And yes, you ARE supposed to talk about it. A good therapist can handle the conversation because they have been trained to. Transference is part of therapy. It's necessary for  therapy to work. It's not a distraction or something that gets in the way. It's a part of therapeutic work. And erotic transference is just another form of transference. This has been well-known going all the way back to Freud.",
        "14205": "It's definitely better handled in this type of scenario if that's even the right word haha. Better dealt with in a situation with a trained professional who knows how to handle this and is trained in helping a client learn to deal with it. You can't avoid people forever. I get transference towards women old enough to be my mother. Guess what there are tons of them and I can't avoid them forever. Better dealt with in therapy than in a situation that could get seriously messy",

I've had a therapist who responded in the same way, and actually shamed me afterwards saying I was not trying at all (I replication of the abuse which lead to the coping mechanism).

It probably helps that he\u2019s passionate about mental health and is training to become a counsellor himself. \n\nBut if he tells me something personal about himself, he\u2019ll ask at the end if I have any questions.

I said I'm afraid of repeating a certain action, she said \"then don't repeat it\". I went on a rant about how it's not that easy, and she pointed out this means I can't rely upon myself. I don't keep promises toward myself. It's about giving myself the same level of reliability that I give to, and expect from others. It made me view my behaviour in a different light. Before, I always viewed it as \"I have to be disciplined\", and now, I see it as \"I want to be a good friend to myself\".

        "14460": "This is just a response to something that's an unspoken expectation that the institution of therapy seems to present. CBT as a modality is a good example because it targets the thoughts you have as the source of the problem instead of the cause of some of those thoughts as the real issue. Therapy is also something that is is recognized as something that is largely acquired by people with privilege (money, access) and mostly lacking in diversity because many of the founders of modern psychology and the modalities are white, and there is a noted lack of therapists who are people of color in the industry itself. If you're looking for someone who is making this claim, its largely poor people of color who dont have access to therapy or who are being told that its their fault they are depressed or that if they could only change their thoughts they would get better. Being told largely by white therapists.",

Putting the entire responsibility on the individual (oh they just need counseling) rather than seeing the collective system involved in creating such a situation. It's a both/and. Yes individuals need and deserve support and help. AND We also need to acknowledge (and hopefully work collectively to correct) the larger systems that create so much stress/imbalance on the individual. \n\nFor example, take a medical resident that commits suicide. Everyone says \"oh that person needed counseling.\" Hell yes that person needed support and counseling. AND the administration that creates incredible demands for this person, the family system that puts achievement over health, the hospital system that puts profits over well being of employees....ALL of that needs to be addressed too.",

If we think we can't do much right because of how we were raised we won't try hard to get that job that requires a bit extra training with a bit more responsibility but pays way better.

I remember once going in and agonizing to my therapist that I didn't think I was cut out for my current career but had no other marketable skills. He then told me, in all seriousness, that the only limit to what we earn *is what we decide to make it*. I remember looking at him, literally doing a face palm, and saying that his was an *awfully* libertarian point of view. (In hindsight, there were probably better insults that would apply to the pov he shared.)\n\nI then asked whether all the struggling people in our society (the US) were just not thinking big enough. He backtracked and said he just meant to refer to me, not them. \n\nI guess given that he found a profession where people pay him a lot of money per hour, out of pocket, to share that kind of wisdom, it's no wonder that he doesn't quite understand the difficulty of some people's financial struggles.",
        "14469": "Pretty much my impression, yeah.  Like obviously there *are* situations where an individual might be helped in solving issues like economic struggles or draining job conditions.   But I've known a lot of people who get really burned out and self-blaming due to \"You, individually, can solve all your problems if you just work on yourself enough!\", and for issues that are more systematic, it can be helpful to recognize the problem is not *individual unwillingness* to make positive changes.\n\n(Also, I feel like there's sometimes a significant gap in people's experiences around attitudes towards therapy that can make something which is really relatable for some people just confusing for others.  In most of the social environments I've been in, the norms can be intensely, almost *aggressively* pro-therapy, in a way that feels weirdly entangled with things like the wellness industry.  And for people who've heard a lot of that, it can be immensely helpful to explicitly acknowledge the limitations of therapy.)",
        "14470": "It wasn't a hot take to me. It's what I was taught when I earned my MSW 15 years ago. I understand and resonate with it though. Here in the US, positive psychology and others like CBT can easily make it feel like a better life is entirely within an individual's control, when many issues that impact mental health are entirely systemic and 100% tied to colonialism",
        "14471": "That wasn\u2019t meant as a burn on therapists if that is why I was downvoted.\n\nIt\u2019s more of a comment that therapists that I\u2019ve encountered don\u2019t (or can\u2019t?) analyze with an anti-capitalist perspective.\n\nA lot of the responsibilities are on the individual, and not the systems, which itself is very disappointing.\n\nThe current global economies can\u2019t function without oppressed people who believe they aren\u2019t enough to some degree. \n\nAnd it\u2019s demoralizing & disappointing & depressing",

I make 10 year goals and accomplish them in a 10th of the time.  All this cause I took responsibility for my life, no one came and saved me.  It all started when I started watching Jordan Peterson\u2019s old lectures.  They spoke to me, but believe what you want about how helpless you are and how you need to be born into family wreath or \u201clucky\u201d.  Bear your burdens, have some aims.

If be curious what your therapist thinks about that. To me, a fellow non-therapist, I want to say that it's totally legit to disagree, but I don't know. I think I would mention that.

Ex: \"tired\" does not = \"unfocused\" or \"sleepy\" with no other words available (there's also exhausted, drained, apathetic, etc.) And you can feel unfocused without feeling tired, they don't really go together for me personally. IMO this wheel specifically kind of sucks lmao",

It's also kinda nice when I'm stuck and can't identify what's wrong. \n\nIt's definitely not 100% accurate tho, I even had a few T's tell me that. Don't think that just because it's written and structured a certain way, that it's always the case. You can have emotions in the inner wheel but dont match the outside wheel.

        "14504": "I\u2019m autistic, so identifying my emotions has always been difficult. The wheel made things a bit easier, but once I grasped the concept of the wheel and it\u2019s tiers, it almost felt too limited? Like, my T would get confused/try to redirect entirely when id use a feeling not under the wheel but under one of the subsequent categories. Good to start off with but I wish it was more broad sometimes",

For me, \u201cnumb\u201d is also a branch of \u201csad.\u201d I also question jealousy not being a branch of fearful, though I would revoke that if they added \u201cenvy\u201d somewhere on there.\n\nThat said, in some ways it is very helpful. It does allow me to realize that many emotions are intricate and boil down to deep-rooted, more discrete feelings.",
        "14507": "I love the feelings wheel!!! I drew my own because it felt so impactful. An important piece is missing here, the division and labels of \"needs are met\" and \"needs are not being met\". That has helped me frame a reasoning for my feelings.\n\nETA: upon further review I don't like this particular wheel. When it's laid out symmetrically you also get an indication of \"opposites\".",
        "14508": "It's a case by case thing for me\n\nWhen it comes to trauma, I'm particularly careful. I prefer expressions of emotions where, say, adjectives are included, rather than a wheel, which excludes  ambivalence. Also, in the beginning of a healing process or when a deeper layer is discovered, an emotion or a group of simultaneous ones can be too difficult to process right away. This happens especially if the emotion(s) are intertwined with past abusive reactions from caretakers, an overwhelming natural disaster, a newly diagnosed chronic physical illness or when an emotion is particularly intense. In order for a person to survive difficult situations, emotions can also be repressed or cut off so powerfully that numbness or an empty space is perceived or the emotion is only present in the constant trembling of one hand, tense back muscles etc. Emotions can also be completely obscured by other, seemingly irrelevant emotions or behaviours - or even needs, which would not be there without the trauma. \n\nIn these cases I'd be really careful with introducing emotions before a client is ready to make their emotions their own. Someone who has had an severely authoritarian upbringing, may say they feel what they think the therapist expects rather than what they're actually feeling. \n\nSome examples of emotions with adjectives: *Trigger warning just incase* \n\nUnmovable helplessness, powerless anger, nameless fear, hateful anxiety, hungry guilt, lonely hope etc. \n\nSometimes authentic adjectives may seem arbitrary and hard to understand, but that only happens before the necessary connection is uncovered",

Frankly, anything more than this is probably too complicated\u2014the exception being someone who wants to learn more \u201cfeeling words\u201d in order to help them discuss their feelings. But most people still need to learn about the basic six. Keeping it to six really helps figure out what you are feeling. The underlying theory is that the emotions are part of the sensorium. And if you are healthy, they motivate you to get your needs met in an appropriate way. Fear lets you know that there is a danger and to \u2018fight or flee.\u2019 Sadness lets you know that you have experienced a loss, and that you need to replace (recathect) something. Anger lets you know that there is something unfair in your environment and motivates you to seek justice. Further, neurotic symptoms can be understood as using an inappropriate emotion to avoid feeling the appropriate one. One example would be acting angry to avoid feeling grief (i.e., sadness).",
        "14513": "Hard no. I think that grouping some of these emotions as forms of other emotions is flawed at best and potentially confusing.

I discovered that my feelings were almost always connected to thoughts, like two sides to a coin. I learned how to relate my feelings and thoughts to my needs and values. I was able to stop the head spinning, constant rinse cycle going on in my head. I found this wheel to be magic.",
        "14515": "I personally have not; it's never been about not having the \\*words\\* for me so much as having someone point out when I'm feeling something and asking me to slow down and explore it.

I don\u2019t like this wheel because \u201cbad\u201d isn\u2019t an emotion, and some of the related emotions are confusing, hard to follow the creator\u2019s logic. I\u2019m not sure who made this but I doubt it was made based on our current understanding of emotions from a science/research perspective. I use this and a grid I found made for writers to help expand their emotional vocabulary. When I use these tools it\u2019s just to help expand and create nuance in emotional understanding and expression.\n\nIt has utility in some situations but lacks in lots of areas. \n\nPersonally, I showed this to my husband to joke about \u201cbad\u201d but he actually saved it in his phone and uses it sometimes.",

        "14543": "I find it odd that it\u2019s called a \u2018feelings\u2019 wheel since feelings are the bodily sensations that arise, such as tighness in the chest or butterflies in the stomach. Whereas it would be better described as an emotions wheel - working from the coarse centre and refining outwards, and then sense the associated bodily sensations.\n\nI saw a great picture a couple of days ago which had a bunch of bunched up colors representing emotions on the left, and on the right it had them neatly lined up in a grid - that\u2019s how I see the wheel being useful in unscrambling our emotional soup we live in",

But then, I realized that's kind of the point - I didn't get the parenting growing up that taught me how to identify my feelings so that's what we're doing now. \n\nMy feelings vocabulary was like four words...lol. I found the feelings wheel really helpful in drilling down into more specific emotions.",
        "14545": "Yeah I feel like this is what has me struggling cuz I\u2019d feel like they are misplaced, like worthless should b under sad.. I could b wrong. Maybe I\u2019m not understanding fear and that\u2019s y I think that. Or I can\u2019t find the word. So I choose a few and I guess it\u2019s cause more confusion for me.",

        "14549": "\"I feel bad\" is often my starting point (even before/without the wheel) and the words they use there help to break down what those feeling might actually be are generally descriptive of what I'm experiencing. \n\nTo me, it's kind of like that feeling as you're just starting to get sick: you know you feel off, you feel bad, but it's more of a general malaise than a specific symptom or feeling. From a colloquial linguistic perspective and for people who may have limited interoception or other complications, this makes perfect sense. (It's also really helpful for kids. I do think a \"I feel good\" section would be a useful counterpoint though)\n\n(I'm autistic. To me, feelings don't have to be specific limited emotions (\"I feel tired\" is a feeling, but not an emotion, though often it overrides any others), and they aren't necessarily accompanied by the thoughts of those emotions. Neutral is also an option we aren't given enough)",

        "14553": "then maybe it\u2019s not the right tool for you :) \n\nin my experience, it\u2019s difficult for me to really describe or tell other people how im feeling, so i will use baseline general emotional states to describe EVERYTHING. it can be difficult for others to understand me and my needs, and it\u2019s difficult for myself to do so as well because i don\u2019t have the language to describe little specific emotions (how i would describe the outer circle, not saying they are \u201csmall\u201d emotions). when i can understand the driving force, \u201creal emotion\u201d, or trigger to my BIGGER emotions (inner circle), i feel like i have a much richer understanding of how to manage, express, or simply identify what im going through. \n\nif you can already identify these in yourself, that may mean you\u2019re at a different point or require different tools in your therapy sessions, bring this up to your therapist and they may have other options for you, i don\u2019t know what you\u2019re in therapy for but if things aren\u2019t working or seem repetitive without progress, let your therapist know! \n\nhope this helped in some way :)",
        "14554": "Yeah, I think you\u2019re right that it is confusing. My initial response to your post was going to be that I do find it helpful, because \u201chow do you feel\u201d is always a much easier question for me when it\u2019s multiple choice. But in truth I think just having a list of emotions is just as good if not better than the wheel.\n\nEdit: Also I think this is a particularly bad wheel. I think there are ones with just two levels that are a lot less confusing/inaccurate.",
        "14555": "Yes it's confusing. I used to just sit and study this one for long time and still could not get it. Then one day got the idea to search for 'feelings wheel for kids'. It's a basic one and the only one I feel comfortable to work with. Somehow I have gotten better at identifying my feelings. From \"I'm not sure\", now after thinking about it for minutes, I'm able to name the feeling. So it did help me somehow.",
        "14556": "Yeah - don't take that element too seriously - it's really just a prompt with a lot of words to help you pin down what you're feeling with more specificity. There's nothing scientific about the categories.",
        "14557": "I\u2019m create when I\u2019m angry and sad more than when I\u2019m happy. I use them as single items too and may look at the hierarchy to see if I\u2019m feeling anything else. Actually what I found really helpful was looking at the emotions that are written on a scale from mild to severe. It really helps me to use the right word.",
        "14558": "I don't think the things can ONLY be in the places they are set on the wheel, it's more like a suggestion of where they might fit so that people who have no idea can start to narrow it down. If you know that a feeling is different to how the wheel places it then you can go ahead and express that without using the wheel.",
        "14559": "It also doesn't clear up things like anger being secondary to fear.",
        "14560": "https://www.gottman.com/blog/printable-feeling-wheel/\n\nThis looks similar to the one I was thinking of. I like the use of joyful rather than happy, and powerful is a great opposite for angry (powerless).",

I don\u2019t mean that citing a valence isn\u2019t useful, it just doesn\u2019t fit into the layout of this wheel. If bad is there, where is good?\n\nRegardless of what other commenters have said about this I\u2019m not going to chastise a client for saying \u201cI feel bad\u201d or \u201cthis is how I feel,\u201d I go with what the client says. If I\u2019m using this wheel, the goal is to go from a general feeling to a more specific feeling if the client wants to develop a better understanding of their emotional experiences and improve emotional communication.",
        "14562": "These are all constructs we use to describe biological processes combined with social contexts. I hate when people tell me this or that are not emotions/feelings. If I lifted up a piece of paper and said \"this is how I feel\" and riped it in a bunch of peices id say you might know what I mean. If I also followed it up with context it would make even more sense. Learning words to comunicate is helpful but not the end all be all of communication/emotion. Some cultures even have words to describe emotions we dont have, or that we need (assuming you speak english) to use sentances to describe.\n\nTherapists can do much better at being empathetic instead of saying \"you are wrong use the words I say to use\".",
        "14563": "I find it helpful to connect it to a recent event or something im doing. At any given moment we are all feeling a lot of different things all at once depending on what is going on. Saying \"how are you feeling\" is really hard to answer. Like, how do I feel about you asking that question of me? Or how ive been feeling in general? How long in general? Like the last 5 minutes? The whole week? About what is happening in the future? Asking me how I feel in any moment is near impossible to say so most people just say \"good\" because it is a catch all. Give me a specific moment in time with a context and I can tell you how I feel about it way better than a general abstract question like \"how do you feel\".\n\nIm eating food right now typing this, id say im feeling content and happy, my mouth feels buttery, I feel warm and joyful. Connecting things to an outside expierence is a little easier in my opinion. Emotions change quickly depending on what you are thinking about and where you are.",

        "14565": "Thanks! I still really don't understand how it's meant to work. For example, a lot of the outer emotions here don't appear to be actually linked to the inner emotions - they're not more specific expressions of the inner one, they're different emotions entirely, or even linked to a different inner emotion. If anything I would have thought it worked in the opposite way... you feel vaguely sad so you pick a type of sad you think is near what you're feeling. But again I don't really understand how naming it is meant to help. It doesn't change what the feeling is. \n\nI actually left therapy because it didn't help me. Therapy entirely was not the right tool for me :)",

Later that evening she emailed me a Buddhist meditation she said made her think of me about how nothing that we feel in our hearts with tenderness and kindness should bring us shame, but should instead we should be warm toward the feelings and just feel what we feel. \n\nYour post is another good reminder of it all!

No one else in my life knows more about me than her. No one else in my life has helped me through so many traumatic events, events other people in my life don\u2019t even know happened because they are centered around addictions which I keep secret. She is open to me texting her when something goes wrong. I have an on call therapist how amazing is that. I had a break up and not five minutes later she is texting with me helping me through it. I was 5150ed and as soon as she found out she called the hospital to check on me during probably one of the worst experiences of my life. It isn\u2019t weird that she is one of the most important people in my life after all we have been through what would be weird is if she wasn\u2019t.",

I\u2019ve been feeling kinda stupid for getting attached since it\u2019s got an expiration date and I\u2019ve got a bunch of feelings and feel like that\u2019s annoying and dependent, especially because I don\u2019t have much support outside of therapy.

        "14597": "Yes, therapists are human! To take this in a bit of a different direction, for the most part, they are not gods, not angels, not superheroes. They are human!\n\n\nSo I agree with the OP that it\u2019s totally normal to feel intensely for your therapist in weird and wonderful ways. But I also always try and stress here that therapists don\u2019t have all the answers. They\u2019re not perfect. They don\u2019t spend all day and night analyzing every micro interaction with clients. \n\n\nMost therapists have very little training on transference and counter-transference. So while this sub is pretty obsessed with transference/attachment, your therapist may not actually know how to skillfully navigate those waters. Next time you see your therapist, you can ask them straight up what they know about different types of attachment and theoretically sound practices for working with attachment issues. Also, most therapists receive little to no supervision once they finish school so they may not recognize or know what to do with their own counter-transference. They may act in very *human* (i.e., faulty) ways towards you that go against the *idealized therapist* trope. \n\n\nSome people here are blessed with wonderfully caring, well-trained therapists who are not super burnt out but many are not so lucky. So please, as much as you can, be vigilant in your own care and mental health/illness journey. Educate yourself and stand up for your rights as a client. \n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f",

In a different way albeit, but the attachment and care is still there. I think you're right in that it would be hard to experience a relationship with as much emotional closeness as the one in therapy without a bond forming.",

I recently saw a post here where someone was asking what\u2019s the best advice your therapist has ever given you and you know what that is in my case? Nothing. Just, nothing. I got very attached to my therapist, but i think she kind of fucks with my feelings. She called me childish when i was suicidal, she laughed when i started talking about my fantasies, she had a pretty unprofessional response to self-disclosure. So why do i keep paying her? Well, i guess i depend on her too much. She hurts me, but i still want to see and talk to her. \n\nSo i think many clients know that transference is normal, but i don\u2019t think they are treated like they should be by their therapist.

        "14604": "Therapist here. Thank you for such a lovely post. It truly warmed my heart. I own a private practice and have been a therapist for 25+ years. The last 16 months has been HARD. I love my job. I do. I care deeply for many of the individuals I have the privilege to work with and for. Do I need to know what in the hell I am doing as a therapist? Yes. But more importantly, do I have chemistry and can build a therapeutic alliance with this individual? My ability to BE IN relationship with my patients is what drives my passion and commitment to make a difference in others lives and leave this world a better place when I am gone. I have VERY clear boundaries with patients. We need them so that the environment can be fully safe and healthy. I also use my relationship with them as a tool in so many powerful and healing ways (if appropriate to what they are seeking treatment for). It is truly an honor and a privilege to be allowed into someone\u2019s most intimate and private parts of their life. It is a responsibility that I take very seriously. I am humbled by each and every person who has the courage to choose to come to therapy, and they are paying me a shit-ton of money to help them get better so I want to give excellent quality of care. I am so grateful for the patients who can see my humanity. Sometimes we have patients that treat us like shit, I kid you not. But I stay in the trenches if I know there is a purpose to the battle. (I will fire their ass if they are repeatedly shitty). The last 16 months has been a battle. I have worked more hours than I want to admit. Our community is swamped with need and I am already almost booked through this next December. While I was worried about how the fuck I was going to keep my own business going/stay safe/protect my family/pay my bills with the shutdown\u2026 I needed to be there for my patients. I was NOT going to stop seeing my people, no matter what. I have been exhausted, yet joyful and grateful every day. Thank you to each and every one of you who chooses to trust us with your mind and heart. I speak for many when I humbly say, \u201cTHANK YOU.\u201d",
        "14605": "An interesting story to add \u2026 I remember years ago when I was buying my home. An excellent realtor came to me via a friend\u2019s referral. During the buying process, my realtor and I called and emailed and texted, day and night, for a couple of months. \n\nI found myself becoming \u201cobsessed\u201d with her. I thought about her a lot in non real estate-related contexts (e.g., I\u2019d be out shopping and say, \u201cOoo, I\u2019ll bet Susie would LOVE this dress!\u201d). I liked her so much. I wondered if I LIKE-liked her (We\u2019re both straight and she\u2019s married). \n\nIt was quite hard when the sale went through and we were no longer in regular touch. I remember trying to continue the regular texting and inviting her over to \u201csee the new place furnished!\u201d She artfully declined.\n\nI eventually forgot about her.\n\nSome distance (plus this thread) has helped me see \u2014 I might not have received kind, competent attention in my early life. It is human to want that. When I experience it \u2014 I love it! I want more of it!\n\nNow that I have this insight, I can give myself a break when I feel I\u2019m becoming \u201cobsessed\u201d with someone (like my T) and talk it through with my little parts. \u2764\ufe0f \n\nThanks again, OP.",

And in a \u201creal relationship\u201d I would spend way more than 1 hour per week talking to them. So that part does feel artificial. Because I have to work up those feelings, and then separation anxiety for two weeks and then happy for an hour, rinse and repeat. I\u2019m really not happy with how it works, but I guess it does...",

        "14615": "Well now....whoa there a second hoss.\n\nThere's a big difference between a human connection and transference.\n\nYou're correct that when you're in a long-term relationship with a T, and that T is the one person who knows and can comfortably discuss all the aspects of your life, there is going to develop a level of intimacy between you.\n\nBut the role of the therapist is what's known as the \"intimate stranger\"...the term was originally applied to teachers, but it's the same thing here.\n\nBecause the people who help you in this world MUST remain strangers to you. The teacher has multiple classes, and with each passing year, a new class takes their place. Your therapist has multiple clients. They are duty bound to treat everyone equally, no matter how much they may happen to \"like\" or \"dislike\" this one or or that one. THAT's the \"stranger\" part of the equation.\n\nAnd at a certain point, you're going to get better (at least, that's the plan), and move on so they can help someone else more in need.\n\nSo intimacy? Sure. Natural. There may even be genuine affection. There usually is.\n\nBut they have a RESPONSIBILITY TO YOU to keep a measure of distance, even if they honestly like you, maybe more than another client.\n\nIf the \"stranger\" role breaks down that makes it very difficult for them to help you. Because they're naturally going to seek to protect you from pain, rather than help you confront and navigate through pain. They've got to push you into places you don't want to go, and you've got to expect that they're the person who will do it...but also get you through to the other side.\n\nTransference actually has nothing to do with genuine affection. It's a con your mind plays on you to direct your thoughts OUTWARD instead of INWARD. The problem is....the only way you get better is to keep the focus inward. All outward looking is just misdirection. Even if it FEELS like you love/lust after your therapist, what's REALLY going on is just your mind trying to distract you from the painful stuff.\n\nSo weird? No. Shameful? No. Typical and expected? You betcha.\n\nBut finally....an impediment to actually making progress? Bingo.\n\nSo they're going to have to help guide you past it and back to yourself. Truth is, if you feel weird or ashamed....that's THEM not doing their job, not your fault. Your only responsibility is to show up.\n\nSo it's their DUTY to keep a certain distance, and to help you deal with all the misdirections. It's IN YOUR BEST INTEREST to recognize the misdirections for what they are. \n\nY'all gotta remember: the goal is to make it so you like YOURSELF best. Even better than you like them. And if they do their job right, that's where you're going to end up.",
        "14616": "True. Remember though at the end of the day it's your money. If you want to see someone else do it. This isn't a normal relationship. It's not \"cheating\" to seek out a better one. It'd be nice to give them some closure but remember you pay for this so don't feel to bad.\n\nThe world is full of troubled people when you leave someone else will foot the bill.\n\nThey are nice helpful people DOING A JOB.

Therapists cannot expect the general public to know how to navigate this and it is our responsibility to know how biases and transference is affecting the therapeutic relationship and to maintain a level of boundaries in order for the relationships to show up in people\u2019s lives where therapists no longer are filling that role. And, when I\u2019m looking for a therapist I try to find out about their orientations, how their experience relates to my goals and general preferences to be able to have that kind of communication and clarity.

I can\u2019t help but wonder if you\u2019ve asked yourself how you can apply what she\u2019s offered you to yourself? While we all deserve mother figures in our lives, a big piece of my personal healing g has been with a therapist who helped model healthy mothering but also empowered me to realize I can do this for myself, and anything on top of that is a beautiful bonus.

I'm hoping the transference stuff doesn't carry over cause Jesus its been painful and I'm really not keen on repeating all of that \n\nMy goals with the new T look different because myself and both Ts are going in with the knowledge that this is a temporary relationship born of necessity. Since my T is going away, and since I have a large amount of feelings both about her absence, her illness and the open ended nature of her absence, this gives me a safe space to talk about all that, without the inherent difficulties of telling my T all about how them being sick is affecting me. At this stage all I know for sure is she is intending to come back but that I'm looking at minimum 3-6 months before that happens. As you can imagine, and as I've talked about fairly frequently in the last month and a half this has been extremely painful \n\nMy goals with this new T look like continuing some of the work I've done with my T although in different ways, and  hopefully being able to carry the sense of safety and security my T has created for me in the last nearly 3 years into the new relationship for however long it may last",

And congrats on disclosing it in the first place, that\u2019s a huge step in itself \ud83d\udc95 I think what really put me at ease was that he totally validated the experience, he said considering what I\u2019m going through at the moment it actually makes a lot of sense to be feeling this way, and just hearing that alone was really helpful to me. He also asked me questions that I hadn\u2019t asked myself - things like do you feel safe? How do you feel when these thoughts come up? Do you notice the thoughts come up at any particular time? We worked through some of my answers to those questions, and also some things I could maybe do when the thoughts come up which made me feel like I had a bit more of a grasp on the situation, rather than feeling totally out of my mind and not knowing what to do with all these thoughts. I totally understand that it\u2019s scary bringing this topic up (hence why I also only said it right at the end but then he uno reversed me and stayed lmao) but I hope you\u2019re able to also talk through how you\u2019re feeling and have a validating experience too, you deserve it \u2764\ufe0f",
        "14721": "Right! I feel very lucky. This gesture meant the world to me as well, especially as like you I\u2019m his last client of the day so I bet he can\u2019t wait to be done most of the time! Thank you, wishing you well too!",
        "14722": "It\u2019s a pretty common practice to extend sessions or increase contact with clients during moments of crisis or when they have feelings of suicide. It doesn\u2019t sound like he crossed a boundary to me. It seemed like it was impactful and that is great to hear!\n\nEdit: Well perhaps it is crossing a boundary by extending sessions, but it's not unethical and it's a therapeutic boundary crossing I think.",
        "14723": "My therapist also does phone consults between sessions! It helps especially if she doesn\u2019t have an available slot at the last minute. I would sometimes apologize to her as I don\u2019t want to bother her with my problems when she\u2019s done for the day or on weekends but I always make sure to ask if she has time to talk as a sign of respect for her time and space.",
        "14724": "That's a different thing though? And also it's a mixed bag for sure. But I've been reading along for a few years now and the amount of time people got warned about boundaries is excessive.\n\nI think we should only warn about boundaries when a therapist is obviously crossing them. But when clients push on the boundaries, it's between that therapist and the client and not some subreddit that only hears half the story.\n\nSure we can give advice based on what seems to be commonly accepted but every therapist and modality and client is different.",
        "14725": ">I find this sub very weird in its expectation that therapists should validate everything clients ever think, say, or do.\n\nI find the opposite. I see stories every day of therapist inappropriateness with blatant dismissals. I see and agree with your side of the argument, but please be aware that there's also a major issue with the pendulum going the other way. And maybe part (not all, but part) of what you are calling \"weird\" is a response to that.",
        "14726": "Yes. The simplest way to explain it is this. How would you feel about your Therapist if you had a major thing going on in your life and you had to wait In the lobby for an extra 45 minutes? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
        "14727": ">I would sometimes apologize\n\nI call him and when he answers I identify myself as his \"needy client\" calling him again.

Though there are also quite a few people who when they can find the energy (myself included) try to shine some light on that. But yes, this is a place with people with a whole lot of intense feelings and desires.\n\nHowever, my point stands. Whenever someone asks about giving a present, emailing the therapist, asking for an extra session, asking for a phone call etc it's like 'boundaries!'. And that's my point, clients needn't worry about that. The T can deal with that. \n\nBut the sub has grown a lot the last year or so, doubled maybe even tripled. So yeah, I maybe still see things how they were when it was only 10k people and not that many posts.\n\nedit: I do want to add, when I just started coming here, as someone who doesn't have these intense attachment issues (instead it took me over 2yrs to feel any attachment at all), I was harsh on the people who did, the way you seem to be (though I didn't say it out loud much). Visiting this sub and reading the stories has taught me to not judge it as strongly and to realise everybody goes through their own struggles and process and awareness.",
        "14731": "I agree with you except that I think some therapists actually aren't able to manage their own boundaries which is maybe why it gets called out on here. And also sometimes those boundaries are complicated and what feels okay for the therapist is harmful for the client which is what happened to me (it's a long story) and might be why people are hesitant sometimes.",
        "14732": "I think the complicated thing is, the people who visit here in majority are those with intense attachment feelings and they struggle. So they come here and talk about how hard it is, that they wish they somehow got more from their T. So then when someone else posts who 'gets more', they see only how they'd want that. It's like any echo chamber basically. \n\nI have noticed more therapists on the sub lately, so I hope they can help with some of that too. And it's good you're also looking out for people!",
        "14733": "Yeah that makes sense. I'm actually one of those people with intense attachment. But I learned that I need boundaries at the same time because what I want and what I need are different things. That's why I say that some therapists may not realize that drastically loosening their boundaries might feel fine for them, but it's not helpful to the client. That's not to say the above post is like that though. But I just think some therapists (not all) are not capable of managing their boundaries effectively.",

Other times, as soon as that self-defeating talk creeps up, I have to slooooooowwwwww dooooooowwwwwnnn tiiiiiiimeeee and get mindful, stop the thought, grab it gently, pet it like a little puppy and get all CURIOUS with it. That's what you do, you do not allow yourself a reaction, you give yourself SPACE, get that \"they think I'm ugly and poor\" (I dunno that's what I always think) and say, \"Why do you feel this way? Hey, YOU are not ugly and poor. Well, you are pretty poor, and one time a cow fainted when it turned around and saw you, but it's okay. This person? They are just another person, and you are writing a narrative that they think you are ugly and poor.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe comic just spoke to me so deeply, because I remember years ago being at that spot where every encounter filled me with fear and loss of safety and discomfort. I thought they were all looking at me. They would look at my teeth, or my fat, or my loose arm skin, shit, I dunno! But you do find peace in making space to get curious and gentle with your thoughts, and you can simply acknowledge the thoughts, and like Marie Kondo, wish the shitty thought well, and send it off into the ether. Try it! The next time a self-deprecating thought pops up and you are out in public and you are starting to feel a panic attack brewing, stop everything, take a moment to do your breathing and while you focus on your breath try to track down a couple of the negative thoughts that are driving your reaction to your environment. It's amazing how mindfulness CAN absolutely work wonders. How long has it taken me?\n\nI was in therapy LONG BEFORE I made this account.  It's a marathon, not a race, just keep moving, sometimes it's going to be extremely slow, sometimes you'll even move backwards, but just remember the only end of the race is you dying, so, try to move, Just move. <3",

I'm a therapist and I love when clients feel comfortable enough to to give me negative feedback.  Ask yourself if you feel comfortable enough to tell him. If you don't feel comfortable enough, shouldn't you be able to trust him that much? That's probably something he can work on too. Hope this helps and I hope you get the help you need!",

Honor your own grief and find a way to honor the memory of your therapist. It helped my friend to be able to go to the public memorial service (not the private one) and to send condolences to his wife.

        "14823": "I am so sorry for your loss and for how hard it is to grieve on top of everything else that you were already experiencing and trying to work through. One of my previous therapists abruptly retired without any notice due to a medical diagnosis and during our unexpectedly last session together, the biggest thing we focused on was on how to keep moving forward with my recovery without getting consumed by the loss and what felt like abandonment. It is too easy to get pulled downwards and fall back into bad patterns when trying to deal with a devastating loss. Focusing on how to move forward and on what was next is the biggest thing that helped me to keep going, to keep pushing to get through the difficult emotions, and to accept that I had lost someone important to me, someone I had looked to for support. Obviously my experience is different than yours and I can only imagine what you are going through. \nThis may not make sense or something similar may have been said already but it might be worth trying to process your grief as if you were working through it with your therapist, instead of about your therapist - as if you were in one last session together. What do you think your therapist would say to you if they could - any final words of advice and encouragement, guidance for how to process and manage your grief, some self-guided EMDR exercises you could try maybe, anything like that? Try to remember all the advice that your therapist gave you and try to apply it to your current situation as much as you can. It might be both too soon and/or too painful to consider something like this but it might help you find some sort of closure or at the very least help you to move forward and to hopefully find another therapist to help you process your loss and to continue your recovery. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to feel the loss - and know that you will get through this. I am so sorry that this happened and that there is no easy solution for any of what you are going through. \nI hope this helped in some way and I am sorry if it did not.",

I bursted out all my trauma right from the start, the first time in my life i have done this. I was in a good place feeling optimistic and then when I was on the road on vacation they call to tell me he died of a heart attack. They hooked me up with his practicing partner and that was pretty devastating. His partner was the complete opposite and set me back quite a ways. I\u2019m glad your therapist was able to help you in a positive way.  Maybe this will be a time of growth for you and hopefully you can find another therapist that can help guide you with a fresh perspective. And now you know of some things that were working so take his advice from your sessions and let his work carry on through you and his other patients. It\u2019s normal to have grief from this, just make sure to talk through your feelings and emotions and not let them marinate for too long inside your head. Good luck to you.",
        "14825": "How devastating and confusing. It sounds like he helped you a great deal and in my experience that means you had a real collaboration\u2014and it was probably very gratifying for your therapist.\n\nThere\u2019s a rather nice memoir called Your Voice in My Head about reflecting on a treatment after the death of a therapist (not by suicide) that I think gets at the importance of the relationship.

I get the sense, from what you say, that he very much cared about you and did the extra work outside of normal sessions to make sure you got support. Take time to cry, remember the work you did with him, and talk with someone (friends, another therapist, etc.) about it. The work you and he did will still be here.

I would never come onto my therapist, but I\u2019ve also never experienced a situation either so passionate or so unprofessional that would have allowed it to even become a real thought in my mind. Just started therapy today and trying not to lose trust in the industry of therapy due to my pre-existing doubt even BEFORE my father\u2019s affair.\n\nEDIT: I want to add that I have no anger or judgement towards my father or even the therapist really who were involved\u2014 I just have always wondered how a therapist could see and care for their patients 24/7 in a genuine way and that makes me feel insecure about going to therapy.

That's okay, that's how it is, but there's still feelings.  \n\nI know my therapist cares for me a lot, and I care about her too, so sometimes it's hard that I can't reciprocate in the way I want to. Sometimes I feel like it's somehow incomplete? I don't know how to describe it.",

I've never had a client express these feelings to me before, though I have had at least one or two that I think did have some kind of romantic attachment to me (they terminated fairly quickly after I saw this possibility though we never spoke of it).\n\nI really don't get the sense that my clients are feeling this attached to me, but when I read here it can seem like every client is secretly in love with their therapist, even though I know this is not actually true.",

Luckily We do EMDR only so I don\u2019t have to tell her a lot.\n\nThis is a much more definitive example of actual transference, as opposed to the way many people tend to use it here as a catch-all term for any kind of attraction. Transference's definition is in its name: it happens when some kind of emotional association is *transferred* from a prior relational context into a new one where there's otherwise no logical reason for it being there. It has nothing to do in particular with falling in love or even just catching feels for someone.\n\nIf your therapist makes you feel uncomfortable because she reminds you both behaviorally and physically of your grandmother to the point where you're creating a direct association between them; and that's affecting your relationship with her to the point where you find yourself thinking that you're lucky that you \"don't have to tell her a lot\"... that's a textbook example of transference that's actively impairing the therapeutic relationship, and it's something that you might benefit from addressing with her if you feel comfortable.",

        "14933": "The type of client that visits a forum about therapy in their free time is probably more invested in their therapy than the average client, and that often comes with stronger attachment and feelings.",
        "14934": "While it likely does happen a lot more often than you'd suspect, it's also important to remember that this forum is far from an unbiased sample. Clients who experience these feelings are often distressed or confused by those feelings, and feel they have no one in whom they can safely confide, so they are driven to the safety of anonymous internet forums in hopes of finding others with the common experience.\n\nThat said, psychotherapy is a setting of positive regard and emotional intimacy. Doesn't it seem that it may actually be more surprising if a client *weren't* to experience some romantic impulse, even if it's fleeting? I feel desperately attached to my therapist but outwardly behave aloof if not even a little robotic. I can almost promise you my therapist hasn't much of a clue and would be shocked to know it. So you really never know.",
        "14935": "You said although no one has expressed feelings for you, you did suspect a few to have feelings\u2026 Im interested to know why you thought that? What were the things they did or said that made you believe they may have feelings?",
        "14936": "Don't they train therapists (I don't want to say \"warn\") this is something that can happen? Tell me you understand the reasons this can happen?",
        "14937": "Clearly not everyone experiences romantic feelings/transference in such a degree towards their T, but it does happen. Many clients create some form of attachment to the therapist, but the ones where it is so strong that it can be consuming all of your thoughts are in the minority. As others stated, people who feel these kind of emotions are ashamed and look for comfort, understanding, validation and simply just a way to deal with it. I would say more than 90% of the content on this sub is about transference and all the feelings that come with it so naturally it attracts clients who feel this way. \n\nI think this sub is a safe place mainly for internalizers to let their deepest thoughts and feelings out. Sometimes that includes things that a person can\u2019t say out loud, not even in the therapy room. Since many people on here experience more or less the same feelings towards their T, support and reassurance can be found. This encourages more other people to write about their feelings of transference causing this to be a hot topic. So I guess I would say that this sub is definitely biased and not a representation of the average client who goes to therapy. However, I still think that it is more common these days and that it should be more discussed in the therapy itself.",
        "14938": "I would imagine it happens so much more than you realize. I struggle so much with this with my therapist. I am f and he is m and we are close in age. I have tried to fight these \"fake\" feelings for months. It is not necessary romantic but I want him in my life, to love, care, and be with me. It is overwhelming constantly. I have felt like term with him so many times because it hurts so much.\nHe is an excellent therapist but my feelings towards him seem hurt me knowing it is all some contrived transference and it is not real.",

One case seemed to understand why I couldn\u2019t come to their art show (young adult) The other got very mad at me for telling them I could not go to their work place just to chat with them and hang out (teenager). \n\nI do also suspect that one adult male may have had a slight crush. That was more of an intangible feeling. He seemed to be too agreeable with me and said comments that were pushing the boundaries of the relationship and making  strong assumptions/predictions about my life. It never got in the way of deeper work but I started to get more and more of that feeling before he left.",
        "14944": "I\u2019ve posted about this before, but at least in my program and others I\u2019ve spoken about with some colleagues, it was an issue brought up very little. \u201cTraining\u201d was essentially non existent. With that said, the reasons make sense to a degree, but even with understanding why it can happen it can still be intense to see the reactions on here at times. Especially given that in now multiple years of doing this job, I\u2019ve never had a client directly address this with me.",
        "14945": "Thanks for the input. I definitely wish at least in my schooling it was talked about more. It really barely came up other than as a multiple choice question on some exams. Very little actual discussion around what it looks like and how to help process it. I think that\u2019s a major flaw in our current system.\n\nWith that said, while I do know it\u2019s not the majority, it is somewhat reassuring to read your response. I really hope that the majority of my clients either do not have intense romantic feelings for me (or should I say the idea of me) or if they did would be willing to share that in session with me. I certainly would not shame this for them and think it\u2019s 100 percent worth exploring.",
        "14946": "I did not see this post you're talking about, but based on this description alone, I have concerns.\n\nTo tell someone that they should 'stop that' because they are having feelings for their therapist seems like it would be very invalidating and isolating. We cannot control our feelings, only our actions. If a person develops romantic feelings, they can't help that.\n\nNow, if a client is trying to be forceful with the therapist, and cross boundaries such as touching or finding them at home or in public, that is a problem. In this kind of situation a client would be considered dangerous.\n\nBut in many cases people have these feelings but they aren't crossing boundaries, they're just trying to deal with it. It can already feel shameful to feel this way about a professional. So for a group of people to tell someone to stop as if it's wrong, is not helpful at all. You can't just 'stop'. You have to work through it to come to a resolution. Just trying to ignore it or pretend it's not there will only further impact that person in a negative way.\n\nI don't mean to go off on you or anything, and it's true I did not read this post and comments myself. But I think it's important to explain more about this perspective, because a lot of people try to struggle with it alone, feel guilty, and the don't get anywhere. In order to heal the wounds from this unmet need, it's important to have a supportive figure there to talk about it.",

And I say that without meaning to imply that the people who say this are ill-intentioned, because they're probably not. But to pathologize or try to eradicate a client's attachment or attraction? It runs fundamentally *counter* to a healthy approach to therapy. There are even schools of thought that would maintain that such attractions/attachments are a \"jackpot,\" a *goal* of therapy, a distilled source of psychic contents to be observed, processed, and if necessary, healed.\n\nI don't harbor such feelings for my therapist, but far be it from me to get complacent about it, as though I'm doing \"better\" than others. Heck, I think it might even help me if I could access that experience.\n\nEdit: I did not mean to imply that the other user here was being \"complacent\"!

I\u2019m rarely actually drunk, but a little wine makes me me.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend it, I don\u2019t condone it. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s ok. But it\u2019s become a thing in my life and I genuinely don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything wrong. As I said, everyone in my life \u2014 my bf, my parents, my friends, even my boss \u2014 knows I do this, and most of them have verbalized to me directly that it\u2019s a nonissue. Yes, my boss told me I\u2019m allowed to drink on the job. That\u2019s how not drunk I am when I do this.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with this: my psych md knows I do this. She\u2019s said it\u2019s a great, healthy strategy to avoid taking shards, halves, or a whole Xanax. I\u2019ve been prescribed Xanax since before I knew what it was. I was just a kid. And now when I don\u2019t take enough Xanax in a day, I get sick. Wine has a really similar effect on my body, but I have a million times more control over the dose. I take two sips of wine about every half hour, and everyone\u2019s the better for it.",
        "15042": "Oh yeah, for sure!  Wasn't trying to question/doubt you, was just curious about someone else's experience.  I have insanely bad anxiety to the point I am agoraphobic and haven't been able to do basic care things like go to the dentist/doctor because of panic attacks...  I just got my xanax prescription last night, am eager to try it though.  She said it was a light dose so I hope I will be ok.  I wonder what it would have been like to have my anxiety at least acknowledged as a child though instead of abused for it (not saying xanax is good for kids, idk anything about it yet, and from what you say I definitely wouldn't have wanted it then).  I've been on the bad side of being medicated with crap as a kid though (therapist says it counts as mental health munchausen's by proxy) so I really do get you...\n\nI totally get the light drinking thing too.  With cptsd/gad, and probably adhd, I am more anxiety than I am human.  The only way I can go out or be around other people is to drink, but I am a light drinker as well!  Though I do like to get a little tipsy, it's the only way to push past anxiety, so more than a couple sips.  I don't even drink every day, and I just have somewhere between half a glass of wine to maybe 3 glasses if it's an all day event.  I've tried weed (because they say it is healthier), the strain everyone says is calming, and it just causes me to have panic and asthma attacks.  At this point I am just desperate to have a life worth living...  Can't even sleep without freaking out all night sometimes (nightmares, night terrors, flashbacks, etc).  And all I mean by babbling on like this is to let you know I am the last person on earth who will judge someone else on their mental health coping methods, and I do understand alcohol can be used responsibly!  So I hope I haven't offended you in any way and you have a good day!\u2661",

See, I too can make assumptions based on your point of view, but that doesn't mean that I'm right because I don't know you.\n\nAlso let's not act like OP was in a genuine state of discomfort.

        "15098": "Interesting take on shame! I have been ashamed of my shame for a while, having bought into the ideal that a Good Person is perfectly in touch with themselves and emotionally healthy and works through difficulties by reaching out to friends and family, and takes shame and turns it into a thoughtful podcast or a million dollar app, something which they then celebrate with their fifty closest friends at a restaurant in the city that serves only sustainably grown vegan food.\n\nI think I got this from hipster culture and too many profiles of rising young professionals and entrepreneurs. It's a very 21st century point of view imo. See also: toxic positivity. \n\nI'm not sure that it would be any easier to think that shame is Good and Righteous, though. I like how it's sort of torturous either way.",
        "15099": "This has made me stop to consider what the difference is for me that makes some emotions in some situations fine, but other emotions in other situations unacceptable. Which I guess means I have a new journaling assignment. I think for me emotions are generally fine, but wants and needs are unacceptable. Like my self harm scars aren't shameful because they say \"I may be in pain, but I have the decency to handle it myself and keep myself in line.\"\n\nAnd thank you. My therapist has commented on the crystal clear body language I show in session and I thought it was kind of funny. I'm glad it's relatable, though I'm also sorry it's relatable, y'know?",

Whats worse is thinking if they made it or not.  A few were suicidal such as myself and i still wonder to this day if they're still alive. One lady was an alcaholic.

        "15134": "I\u2019m definitely this kind of person. \n\nAt first I hated the fact that I felt like I was wasting a day by prioritising a therapy session that only took up an hour of my day. But it wasn\u2019t until a month ago where I came out of a session and had a scheduled presentation to do for work right afterwards. I could\u2019ve rearranged it, but I crammed that day full thinking I could handle it all. It wasn\u2019t until the hour after my session that I realised \u2018wow, I do NOT feel in the best headspace to do this properly\u2019. \n\nIt\u2019s never a day wasted when you\u2019re figuring out important steps in facing trauma or getting over something. There\u2019s plenty of time for \u2018work\u2019.  Most people don\u2019t leave any time to get to know themselves or resolve things that have held them back for years. \n\nIn a year\u2019s time you might look back on that hour  you spent with your T every Wednesday and realise it was the most pivotal hour of the week for you to get where you\u2019re at.",
        "15135": "I'm absolutely this person, too.. Therapy is at 4pm, so I have to leave work by 2pm to give me chance to get home and into therapy mode. Which means I need to be done with lunch by 1.30pm, so I have lunch at 12.15 because I can't have it later in case something happens to push it back (spoiler: nothing ever happens, but you know. Anxiety.). That means my last meeting of the day can be no later than 11am. I get my Zoom details through for the session between 9am and 10am when my T does her admin, and I can't settle until that email has come through. Which leaves me a window of around 1 hour between 10am and 11am to be productive, which doesn't happen because I need to leave work in 3-4 hours so I don't mess up my therapy routine. So yeah, therapy days are a special kind of day..!",
        "15136": "I\u2019ve learned that this is part of my own ADHD and anxiety. If I have an appointment I literally cannot do anything and I will obsess over it until it\u2019s time. Sometimes I arrive 10-15minutes early and especially with therapy I recheck the appointment time multiple times while I\u2019m waiting(mine are in person again). This is also why I hate working the mid shift at work, I do it with everything. It\u2019s like anticipation dysfunction.",
        "15137": "I see mine every Tuesday at 7pm. I request to be done with work by 3 that day (Just because when I was in IOP summer 2020 it started at 4 and I've since been done for over a year but it's useful for therapy night) and I usually get done somewhere around then but occasionally the person who does our scheduling will forget and put me until 6. I work in a vet clinic and we close at 6, but doesn't necessarily mean we will be leaving then. I tell my coworkers to hurry tf up and let's close cuz I have an \"appointment\"!!!!",
        "15138": "Gotta save your spoons!",
        "15139": "> In a year\u2019s time you might look back on that hour you spent with your T every Wednesday and realise it was the most pivotal hour of the week for you to get where you\u2019re at.\n\nI agree. I feels like all the changes over the past year are adding up to something. However, I just wish I knew what I'm progressing towards, and it gets me down with this dreaded feeling like its all adding up to nothing.\n\n I don't know why, but I always struggle with these types of cognitive dissonance.",
        "15140": "I've tried that before. Been like ah she'll be right and tried to go to work after therapy. Spoiler alert she was not right. Very far from right. I was exhausted and felt exposed and vulnerable all day\n\nFor now this hour is important because it has to be. I'm digging into deep stuff earlier than I thought. I'm digging into pain and fear. I'm digging into the place I keep a scared little girl who wants a Mommy. And that shit is hard. SO for now Wednesday is a write off. But it won't always be. And after this I will hopefully be stronger and more healed than I thought possible",
        "15141": "I love your insight on this, thank you for sharing. My T has helped me so much and I am so grateful for that one in hour in her office",
        "15142": "This is exactly why I used to do my therapy sessions on Friday after I was done with work, when I was still working.",
        "15143": "Wonderful! I also switched careers to therapy at just around that age! I'm almost a year into doing it full time and loving it.",
        "15144": "I love this for you!!!!! I am getting my PsyD after about 7 years being in therapy and various levels of care myself. Let me tell you, it is so amazing to watch people grow and learn to cope in healthy ways. Also, know that your lived experience is valuable. I feel that it helps us empathize with clients in a way that others cannot. Your enthusiasm and the compassion you already feel towards the clients you will work with tell me that you really are going to be a great therapist \u2764\ufe0f",
        "15145": "Excellent! I am in the SAME boat!!!! After several years of my own therapy, I decided to go to grad school. It\u2019s a super scary thing to do at 40 but once my own therapist mentioned that I\u2019d be good at it, I was all in,\n\nBe careful! You\u2019re going to learn what it\u2019s like on the other side of things. Be prepared to accept and deal with diving deeper into your own issues as you learn in class. Just learning about attachment theory has me rethinking a lot of thoughts...\n\nKeep your optimism alive and you\u2019ll be great!",
        "15146": "Congrats! I went to grad school when I was 31 and it was a great decision. :-)",
        "15147": "My therapist was about your age when he went to grad school, too.  Good thing there's no age limit on becoming a therapist. :)",
        "15148": "Awesome! I had been in a number of different therapeutic settings ranging from inpatient, outpatient, group therapy, and of course regular individual therapy long before I became a therapist. I genuinely feel like those experiences help me relate to my clients, remember what it feels like to be on the other side of the dynamic, and it keeps me humble if I ever start getting too lost in my ego with my success in the field.\n\nBest of luck!",
        "15149": "That\u2019s amazing \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd29 LPC intern here and this is also my second career! I was a project manager/account manager for over 10 years before this and I\u2019m 35. Never knew this career was a thing just seen it on TV until I needed a therapist myself. After seeing the therapist I realized I was the therapist for many of my coworkers throughout the years and loved that aspect of it over my actual title, so here I am.\n\n\nWelcome to the club!",
        "15150": "I\u2019m super curious, what led to the realization that you would make a good therapist? Sometimes I wonder if it\u2019s a field I should pursue someday.",
        "15151": "I love that for you! I\u2019m 22 and have always heard that from friends but my therapist saying the same thing has solidified it for me as well. Switching from journalism to psychology and I can\u2019t wait. Best of luck and congrats!",
        "15152": "I was the same. I tried to take my life at 16 and ended up in the hospital for a while. One night I couldn't sleep so I was talking with one of the night nurses, Rev, while I waited for my sleep aid meds to kick in. Somehow we got onto the topic of what I would like to do when I grew up, at which point he said I'd make a great counsellor. He said there was just something about my demeanour that was calming, he also said that I \"oozed compassion\". I'd been interested in psychology for a few years but it was that moment that I decided I wanted to be a therapist. That goal kept me going, and it still does. Last week a client told me that I saved his life, that if it wasn't for me he probably wouldn't be here. Comments like that remind me that I made the right choice. I don't want to make it sound like my life is all sunshine and roses, because it isn't. But everytime things seem like they're becoming too much, I just remind myself that I've got an important job to do.",
        "15153": "I've been in therapy my whole life.  Now I'm in grad school to become a psychotherapist! Lived experience is so important.",
        "15154": "Same here - 7 years of my own therapy, just turned 41.",
        "15155": "This is awesome!! Congrats!!\nI'm also taking a similar route. I want to be an art therapist or just a regular therapist. I want to help people like me and my brother.\nI'll be graduating this spring and going to get a masters in social working after that. Super excited!",
        "15156": "Omg you are all giving me so much hope. \ud83d\ude42\nAfter being in therapy for 9 months and I started volunteering as a trained active listener on 7 Cups. Being on the other side is so fulfilling. I am wondering if I should do a career change, at that crossroad in life, and something in the field of psychology seems very interesting. The problem is that I struggle with social anxiety. I wonder if it is still possible. I am 30.",
        "15157": "This is so sweet and inspiring! I just switched from a lifetime of assuming I\u2019d always be a nurse to going for counseling this weekend! It\u2019s been scary and I\u2019ve been really unsure, but this helps. Best of luck to you, I\u2019m sure your therapist was very right :)",

        "15160": "This post made me smile. I'm so happy for you, OP! Also all the comments are making me feel better about my own situation. I am seriously considering making the switch and applying to grad school to eventually do something in psychology and feel soooo behind even though I'm only 22. It feels like my life is over and that ive wasted too much time, but this thread is helping me realize it's not too late :)",
        "15161": "Same. I\u2019ve been told that, unprompted, by three therapists over the years. I just started my first grad school class this week.",
        "15162": "Omg I\u2019m in the same boat! It\u2019s something I was thinking of casually after several years in therapy, but my therapist\u2019s absolute delight when I told him what I was thinking clinched it for me. He\u2019s said several times since then what an amazing therapist he thinks I\u2019ll be.",
        "15163": "Congrats!!! I\u2019ve been thinking for a long time about going back to school, possibly for a counseling or social work degree. I love seeing others do it!",
        "15164": "SAME!!! Went back to school at the start of the pandemic. Loving the new knowledge I\u2019m gaining!",

        "15166": "Wow, I'm sure you will be an amazing therapist! Well done!\n\nI did the same, even though I started again from scratch with an undergrad degree. Long way to go but I'm so so happy for all of us who made it!",
        "15167": "Same! I\u2019m almost done with my second quarter in an MSW program and am so happy I made this decision. Starting my internship soon and things are finally starting to feel \u201cright\u201d",

        "15170": "Congratulations! This is amazing. I'm happy for you. I've had some thoughts over the past year about doing something similar. Perhaps this was the extra little push I needed to give it more serious thought.",

        "15185": "That\u2019s amazing!!! \ud83d\ude03",
        "15186": "Spent 4 years as a teacher -- then 9 as a software developer -- then decided to get back to something more service-oriented and got a 3yr MSW. Currently working towards my LICSW while also doing some post graduate training in Psychodynamic Therapy. I work full time in an outpatient setting. It's hard work and I'm gonna be poor for a while...... But I've got no regrets.",
        "15187": "I initially entered my social work master's program without actually realizing that you could be a therapist with a social work degree! I was just looking for a career that was more service-oriented, because I knew that would be more fulfilling than what I was doing. But once I was in the program, I realized that the stuff that really made me feel passionately interested and vitalized always had to do with therapy.",
        "15188": "In my past jobs I spend a lot of hours counseling my peers, managers and beyond (yes, I am aware that I am taking a pay cut but this is more fulfilling to me). I was credited for saving a coworker\u2019s marriage and he wrote one of my recommendations letter.",
        "15189": "What were you doing to make them say that :)?",
        "15190": "Sure, message sent.",
        "15191": "Social work! I'm on the fence mostly because right now I'm going through a bit of a transformative period. My long-term relationship just ended and I'm thinking about moving states. So, when everything was stable, I was thinking about going back to school. But now I'm thinking of moving, possibly leveling up in my current career to make some more money. So I think my overall life situation just kind of changed pretty much overnight. So it's just having me question everything I thought I wanted to do and if it's what I still wanted to do.",
        "15192": "I think I just have a lot more work to do on the client side\ud83e\udd2d. Maybe a little jealous. Congrats and good luck!",
        "15193": "That\u2019s so cool! I\u2019ve spent 8 years as a freelance professional literary translator after getting my MA. I amso excited to start this next step though!! Can\u2019t wait to work with real people\u2019s narratives lol!",
        "15194": "Thank you for the insight! I applied to go back for my MSW (I am 34) with the intention of going into private practice afterwards. I guess what I'm struggling with is: I am interested in psychology and learning about theraputic practices but I am struggling if I'm interested in it insofar as it helps explain ME to myself. I'm questioning if I want to take it to the next level and help others.\n\nI feel so torn!",
        "15195": "Haha you\u2019d have to ask her ;)",
        "15196": "Thank you",
        "15197": "That makes sense. When do you need to decide by?",
        "15198": "If you are a literary translator, I'd guess you're very good at verbal expression, which will serve you very well as a therapist!",
        "15199": "I can definitely see that. I certainly can't speak to the question of whether it will be right for you, but I know that my interest in my own problems, traumas, and suffering is a huge part of the reason why psychology is so interesting for me. I think this is true for many, if not most, of the people that go into the field. I also think people who have experienced their own intense mental health problems can often use this to power their own healing efforts for their clients (although we have to be careful not to over identify with our clients or make the assumption that we have been through the same things they have).",
        "15200": "Would be worth asking your therapist for specifics if you haven\u2019t yet! I\u2019m looking into going into therapy myself, and my therapist said that in addition to the traits I have that other therapist friends said would make me a good therapist, I have a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d. It\u2019s nice to get specifics from those that encourage us to pursue this field",
        "15201": "I've been accepted to one out of the two schools I applied to. I'm still waiting to hear back from the other. The first one I have until May 15th. So I'm going to try to talk to some therapist friends before deciding. I think I just really need to do some soul searching as to what my next steps need to be. Because I feel like going to school and starting a new career would be committing to staying in my current state for at least the next 5 years. And I'm not sure I really want that at this point.",
        "15202": "Thank you!",
        "15203": "I appreciate you sharing that insight! I'm trying to talk to more people before committing to it. I have until May 15th to commit and am still waiting to hear back from 1 more school.",
        "15204": "Oh I\u2019ve had her repeat it and elaborate several times ;) I value her view of me so much and it\u2019s made me have a lot more self compassion \u2764\ufe0f",
        "15205": "Also makes sense. But - wouldn\u2019t it just be two years? Are these two year MSW programs? Couldn\u2019t you pursue licensure in a different state after your program is done?",
        "15206": "That\u2019s great!",
        "15207": "I would only be able to go part-time since I support myself on a single income, so most of the part-time programs take 3-3.5 years :/. I could probably do it in 3. If I'm crazy, I guess i can try to go to school full-time and work full-time. My job isn't very hard most of the time so it might be doable. Then I'd get done in about 2 years. \n\nI'm also really committed to not taking on more debt, so both of these are in-state programs that would cost ~10k-$14k/year without assistance. It about doubles to 20-30 if I leave the state.\n\nI guess for licensing, I thought most state schools prepare you for taking the test in that state. Maybe that's not the case? I need to research more",
        "15208": "I don\u2019t actually know to be honest! But it\u2019s definitely worth investigating.",
        "15209": "Thanks for all the feedback. Talking to you actually made me feel excited again about pursing therapy as a career. I also looked into it and it looks like lots of folks work and go to school full-time. My work is going \"remote first\" (we've been at home since March) and one of the program I applied to is online, so I think full-time school and work may be doable in 2 years!",
        "15210": "It won't be a walk in the park but many people have done it! Whatever you choose to do I wish you well. I'm glad I could help in some way.",

        "15235": "This happens to me very often. I now try to write down my emotions on my phone\u2019s notes or something and then I simply bring it up like \u201cI may seem fine now because the sun is out today and whatnot but last week [expose what I wrote down]\u201d. It\u2019s actually a bit devastating because if you were feeling fine, you will be brought back to that time and those emotions and it will feel unsettling, but I think it helps me communicate with my therapist. I don\u2019t know if you have this option, but when having a really bad crisis I try to write them down messages or emails so they bring it up next session and we can discuss things.",
        "15236": "Not crisis as such but I go blank in my sessions \n\nSo during the week things will come up related to stuff we talk about and I may struggle or feel unsettled. The day of therapy I could tell you exactly what I want to talk about with my T \n\nI get in the room sit on that couch and boom. Total blank as if everything had been fine during the week and I had no struggles. Its damn frustrating",
        "15237": "Echoing what some have said about writing things down in the moment or shortly after. This happens to me nearly every time, especially because I tend to feel good on days that I go to therapy, just generally optimistic and motivated to take care of myself. Luckily, I\u2019ve been able to schedule my appointments so that I have an hour of free time before to look through my notes and figure out what I want to say. At first it felt kinda contrived, but my T says that it\u2019s helpful for both of us to really work on what I need to. It usually ends up breaking my thoughts down and can be hard to do/ put myself back in those thoughts, but it\u2019s better than aimlessly chatting for an hour.",
        "15238": "I was JUST talking to my T about this in our last session. I dip to some low points in between sessions & then by the time the next appointment rolls around I walk in like nothing happened.",
        "15239": "Every. Single. Time.",
        "15240": "Oh yeah. Or sometimes I even feel resistant to having my session because at that point I don\u2019t feel like talking about my break down from earlier in the week, day, etc. But that usually tells me that I actually have a lot to work on so I try to push through.",
        "15241": "This is a big reason why people might be discouraged to go to therapy all together. The best time to be vulnerable is when you\u2019re clear, if you\u2019re in crisis you aren\u2019t really rationalizing or perceiving like you normally would. Both sides are extremely important in therapy, but also being honest with your therapist of this exact thought can help them go a different route as well. Good luck friend, you\u2019re going to be okay.",
        "15242": "I\u2019ve been there with panic.. I usually bring it up and we talk about it anyway, or if I have had a really rough week, I often will perk up the day before session, so sometimes I will email her saying it\u2019s been a hard week due to xyz, can you please help me talk about it. I figure that\u2019s what she is there for.",

        "15245": "Sure do! My T said I could email her and describe things if I wanted to, but mostly I just try to log it in my mood journal - I pull that thing up every week when I inevitably forget all about what I wanted to discuss. I use Daylio, just in case that sounds useful.",
        "15246": "Yes, all of the time. I try to write down my issue while I'm in the midst of the crisis but then I am hesitant to tell him, because I'm not sure he'll buy the seriousness of it.",
        "15247": "All the time! I finally got smart and messaged in between when I had stuff come up. Only talked once after first week\u2019s message. Don\u2019t know how it will be going on, but really helped last time. Took me awhile to recall enough, but it works...",
        "15248": "It happens to me a lot. And it bugs me that it never happens during a session. I talk about all this traumatic stuff and leave the session feeling a little exhausted, but all in all I feel fine. Then when I get home I start to cry and want to selfharm or something",
        "15249": "Yes, and I write it all down (as you would dreams if you want to remember them), because otherwise I *forget* the feelings ever happened once they're over, and am a polite blank at my next therapy session. My lifelong coping mechanism has been repression, so I don't always have access to my emotions until a \"crisis\" or \"breakdown\" moment happens, seemingly out of nowhere. I used to think I was \"fine\" between each emotional spike, but now I think I'm just... disconnected. \n\nIt's probably because I've kept *myself* at such an emotional distance that I'm not privy to things till they're an emergency... considering how intensely judgmental I was with my emotions in the past, that's makes sense \ud83d\ude05",
        "15250": "Yes",
        "15251": "This is so relatable. I experience it a lot. I've started journaling when ii feel this way so I can bring it in to therapy even if it feels like its not relevant anymore.",
        "15252": "It\u2019s probably very normal and even good that you are solving your crisis and getting out of harmful thoughts on your own strength. Also we are not in a permanent feeling or emotion so changing emotions between sessions is perfectly normal :)",
        "15253": "This happens to me often, so I started keeping a notepad full of my prior thought processes so I can bring it up to my therapist later. My therapist looked at me a bit odd, so I don't know if that's normal or not.",
        "15254": "I\u2019ve heard a great quote that goes \u201cproblems caused by isolation cannot be solved in isolation\u201d. Some issues are so deep and all encompassing that being alone with them will naturally lead to feeling unstable. I get this exact same feeling myself and something that helps me is reminding myself that I need more context. When things feel unimaginably difficult to comprehend, I believe it\u2019s because we see something in our past without the context of what forged our minds and assume that is who we are.",
        "15255": "I talk about what happened in crisis mode. I generally talk about my whole week, the good, the bad, and the neutral.\n\nI have autism though, so maybe that\u2019s not what I\u2019m supposed to do, but my therapist hasn\u2019t complained lol",
        "15256": "All. The. Time. \n\nFortunately, I'm such a basket case I always find something to talk about.",
        "15257": "Well, it IS all in your head. Where else would it be? In your sock drawer?",
        "15258": "I often find that when I do this not only do I not have any emotional connection to what I wrote anymore, but it feels off...as if some other person wrote it. \n\nI fully remember writing it but the headspace is alien and inaccessible, and I question whether I really meant what I wrote at all or if I contrived it in an attempt to understand what I was feeling?\n\nNot discounting the value of the advice at all I just wonder wtf is good with me lol",
        "15259": "Same here ! That's why the hour before therapy I grap whatever paper and write a list of what I'd like to talk about so that I can check it mid-session and see if I mentioned the most important subjects",
        "15260": "Oh, I feel like this, too. Now that I trust my therapist, on days I know I have a session, I'll feel better simply at the *prospect* of validation and emotional relief. I write down and articulate whatever I want to work on beforehand as well, when I feel able. Sometimes it's as blunt as, \"I'm coming off pretty stable right now, but that's because I'm doing the thing where I perform competence instead of being vulnerable. I'm actually finding it super hard to get out of bed\". \n\nLike, I hide stuff SO well, even from myself. I can't expect my therapist to be a mind reader. She's done the work of gaining my trust, and I gotta do the work to step out of my comfort zone, so I *can* be helped... \"Aimlessly chatting for an hour\". Yup \ud83d\ude05",
        "15261": "No, I definitely can relate to this too! I have also felt this way. To be honest, it\u2019s a process! Sometimes it makes more sense than others, there will be times where you just feel kind of stupid to even mention such thing now that you\u2019re in a good place, but it\u2019s all part of the journey and I think that no matter how you feel about it later on, you should choose to mention it if it had a big impact on you, because even your interpretation of it later on carries a meaning to your therapist and to yourself. The more times you do this the \u201cbetter\u201d and more accurate your descriptions of those moments will feel, and the embarrassment kind of starts to fade a bit with time - not always though, but with time. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you, OP! From where I see it, you just need to find a better way to communicate with yourself on those moments, and think how that could translate the best way into a conversation that you feel is relevant with your therapist. Have you tried mentioning how you feel about this with your therapist? Maybe they have a better mechanism for you that could help you more, this is just my experience and we all operate in different ways.",
        "15262": "Ahaha, I get this exact thing along with what seems like a total personality shift.  So I've tried not only writing it down, but then texting/emailing before the session...  But then I just all of a sudden switch again by the next session...  I've questioned OSDD-1, but I seriously feel like I was just exaggerating and I'm forcing myself to try to fit in that box, and maybe I am just weird (attention seeking and immature excuses)?xD",
        "15263": "Agreed. I journal when I\u2019m in \u201ccrisis mode\u201d between sessions, but then when I try to use my journal in session I get really embarrassed like I was overreacting or being dramatic when I wrote the entries.",

I'm actually scared and outraged for this person's other clients.

I'm sorry he treated you this way.\n\nEta since you asked for experiences: not nearly as bad, but my last therapy was kind of similar. It was group therapy attached to a hospital and our therapists were consistently late, cancelled the day prior, or even sent me home when I had already arrived. On the other hand if one of us ever was late it was a huge thing where you'd have to analyse the deeper meaning every time and get scolded by a nurse like you're a toddler.

        "15357": "I think that\u2019s worthy of a complaint to the medical board wherever you are",
        "15358": "I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you but happy at the same time you didn\u2019t scheduled another appointment and decided to change",
        "15359": "[removed]",
        "15360": "Horrified reading what happened to you. This is reportable to his licensing board...it is abandonment of a patient and absolutely NOT ok.",
        "15361": "These stories reassure me that I am not a garbage/toxic therapist. Nice to know that the actual stories of unethical therapists are things I could never do and the mistakes that actually keep me up at night pale in comparison.",
        "15362": "Oh.. my.. goodness.. that\u2019s unreal. First of all.. if a client is late to doctors appointments, they typically say like 10 minutes or so they\u2019ll make you reschedule and come back. Usually with therapists if the client is late they let you use up the remaining time but they\u2019ll also let you know it\u2019s not ideal and I\u2019ve seen policies that if it\u2019s a habitual thing they will charge you or stop scheduling appointments. Basically what I\u2019m getting at is that there is a window of time if a client is late there is some kind of notice or consequence. He, the professional, was more than 10 minutes late to the appointment. Did he really expect you to sit there indefinitely. He was late, you waited, he didn\u2019t show up, you left. He made the assumption that you were a no-show instead of realizing it was his behavior causing the problem. And his dumb ass assumption caused him to make an ass of himself by retaliating. \n\nBUT even if you were a straight up no show this is beyond unprofessional of him. It should honestly be reported. Someone who is this dysfunctional and unreasonable should not be allowed anywhere near clients. So petty.. and so harmful to people in vulnerable situations where he\u2019s in a position of authority but acting so condescending. What in the world!\n\nEdit: trust in this kind of relationship is just so important. How could anyone trust him again after pulling a stunt like that! Good grief!",
        "15363": "Oof this made me literally feel sick. Like others have said you really didn\u2019t even no show! He is a Jack ass and I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that. Reaching out for therapy is already hard enough.",
        "15364": "What a sack of shit he is for doing this to you! Throw a bag of turd at the dicks face!",
        "15365": "Is it possible that the appointment you showed up to in person was actually supposed to be virtual?",
        "15366": "He sounds really narcissistic",
        "15367": "Please report him!!! He\u2019s sorry as hell",
        "15368": "REPORT HIM. He needs to be retrained and should not be working until he's developed some freakin empathy.",
        "15369": "That\u2019s a whack response and strategy on their behalf. Very immature and retaliatory.",

        "15371": "Man, so many people pointing this out - I did not even consider it that way. You\u2019re right, I\u2019ve been sitting here thinking \u201cWell, I did wrong but his reaction to my wrong was WAY worse\u201d\n\nScrew that guy. I\u2019ve already left reviews on Google and a couple healthcare sites, but I\u2019ll have to look into submitting a proper complaint.\n\nEDIT: I'm really glad to read all these responses because I feel so validated that his was a completely bizarre and unacceptable course of action. Of course I already thought that was the case or I wouldn't have refused the offer to make another appt....but there's always that inner dialogue, that seed of doubt telling me \"It wasn't that bad. It wasn't that big of a deal. You're the problem, it must be you.\"\n\nSo these responses help solidify that, in this case, it wasn't me and it was a big deal.",
        "15372": "My therapist isn\u2019t a psychologist and even if there a chance she\u2019ll be running even 5/10 minutes late she\u2019ll text me as soon as possible to say she\u2019s running a little late and apologies. You\u2019ve done no different to what I would have done and given up. Even I\u2019ve made the error online of accidentally logging into sessions on the wrong codes but a simple message from my therapist to say you\u2019ve clicked on the wrong link for said session was all it took! \nYou need to look after you and see if you can find someone different as this dude clearly isn\u2019t that right match for you from his part",
        "15373": "I'd go so far as to report the behavior.",
        "15374": "I\u2019m glad a T responded. I was even starting to question whether it was deserved. Saying it\u2019s toxic really helps keep a grip on self worth and reality. Thanks.",
        "15375": "It sounds absolutely manipulative and controlling. Their psychologist *punished* them for his own wrongdoing! Even after he'd gotten paid for the session *he* didn't show up to.\n\nIt makes me very concerned for his other patients.",
        "15376": "Good point!",
        "15377": "Absolutely! As a therapist, if a client is 5 minutes late for a session, I start reaching out via text or a phone call to see if they've forgotten or might just be running late. If I haven't heard from them 15 minutes after session started, I assume they're not showing, charge them, and close the session. You gave him plenty of time to show up and deserve your money back. Adding my voice to those suggesting you report him to his governing board.",
        "15378": "Yeah! I dont get the \"scolding you like a toddler\" but either! Like thanks for being super condescending when you're at fault. Fuck off.",
        "15379": "And report him to his licensing board so they can remind him of how to be professional.",
        "15380": "Follow up in case you'd like to report him (and I hope you do) - If you're in the states or Canada, you can Google the psychological association in your state and find out who sits on the ethics board and email them for advice on how to proceed. If you're in Maine or NH, send me a pm.",
        "15381": "I hadn\u2019t even thought of that. If he\u2019s in over his head, he totally could have forgotten/missed the appt, avoided the client for days, until coming up with the idea to frame it as \u201cteaching you a lesson.\u201d Such a person is not doing ok and needs help before continuing to practice, at best. At worst, they\u2019re that rare but predictable scary breed who is super fucked up and using this profession to act out. Yikes. Regardless, I so hope you report",
        "15382": "THANK YOU. That was another reason I kept telling myself at first that it was ridiculous to think he was actually ghosting me....it had been SO LONG since the last interaction that I thought it was vain of me to think he even remembered.",
        "15383": "How does a no-show mess up your day? You're still getting paid for your time, right? But instead of talking with the client, you'd be spending the same amount of time, in the same place twiddling your thumbs or whatever it is you do.",
        "15384": "It would be unfounded though. He isn\u2019t violating any statues. Unfortunately the board doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re just a jerk.",
        "15385": "Therapist also- do you think the board would care? He is being a jerk, but he\u2019s not likely to be violating any statues.",
        "15386": "Me too! Whenever I feel like a crappy therapist, I just read these posts.",
        "15387": "Not possible. He doesn't do virtual appts at all anymore. He was the one to inform me of this when I made the appointment, and when I texted him the day before to confirm, he was sure to remind me that was the case. \n\nWhich now, looking back, seems even more fucked up because he was clearly planning to ghost me and wanted to make sure I'd take time out of my day to drive to his office.",
        "15388": "I hope this was the case. That would be at least somewhat reassuring.",
        "15389": "Was just gonna say the same! He must\u2019ve ACED Gaslighting 101!",
        "15390": "This is problematic in so many ways I don\u2019t know where to start. There a many other ways to support development of insight around these kinds of issues that aren\u2019t unethical, uncontaining, manipulative, damaging to the relationship, petty, transactional, and on and on.  I can\u2019t fathom a therapist landing on this as the appropriate intervention without it being influenced by personal insecurity far more than clinical wisdom.",
        "15391": "Honestly it sounds like he\u2019s the one who no-showed.... twice",
        "15392": "Punctuality is such an under appreciated quality in today\u2019s society and I really don\u2019t get why. So many people I know are chronically late to everything. It is so disrespectful to the person you\u2019re supposed to be meeting with! I was raised to be very punctual and it bothers me to no ends that people seem to think agreeing on a time really means anywhere from 10-30 minutes after (sometimes more) is okay. \n\nAnyway, I agree with the others. If I was waiting over 10 minutes for a session to start I likely would have bailed as well. Your therapists time isn\u2019t the only time that is valuable, yours is too.",
        "15393": "Did you submit the complaint?",
        "15394": "Yeah this is just bad all around. I cant see this being helpful to anyone with any condition in really any situation, and especially not someone with abandonment issues. Not a therapist, just someone who would be pretty disturbed if this was done to me",
        "15395": "Yeah, this is one time I am 100% behind this sub's quick jump to... REPORT!!!xDDD\n\nThis dude should not be practicing like this, he could really eff up a vulnerable person...",
        "15396": "Agree, it\u2019s awful",
        "15397": "I wonder if he made a legit mistake and forgot your appointment, and then covered it up by saying he was teaching you a lesson. Either way, gross.",

        "15400": "Hey that's a nice rock! It looks so smooth, so I bet it's real nice to keep in your hand, along with the weight of it and cool touch. I love the idea of using a rock as a grounding tool! I'm going to have to find a nice rock for myself to use!",

        "15402": "I think having an object in therapy that serves as comfort during therapy is very good. When I use to be in therapy I didn\u2019t have one and I would just hold my hands or play with my fingers during therapy.

My husband and I blow glass so we made a little bowl for them!",

(It reminds me of when I was a kid and i used to think there were tiny elf\u2019s living in the tiny wholes in our wooden (idk the word, it\u2019s not carpet but also not ground. The opposite of selling u know?) and I used to collect stones for them and build them little beds out of colourful (the thing from sheep\u2019s but not the sheep ones but the plant Version my English shit)",

She will even hug and hold me on the couch while I hold bunny and talk to me in a soothing voice to help calm me down when I become scared and little. She is one in million. Maybe try asking your T if you can bring your teddy to therapy? My T even let me wrap myself in a blankie with bunny last week because we were having a very hard time and just needed love.",
